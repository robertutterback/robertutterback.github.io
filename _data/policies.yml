# Course policies, which are versioned since they occasionally change
# things that occasionally change
late_none_v1: "In general, late assignments will *not* be accepted. Exceptions may be made only for situations beyond your control. If you feel your reason is justified, schedule a meeting with the instructor to plead your case."

late_days_v1: "You have each been allotted a *total* of *5* late
days. You may apply these to any problem sets you see fit and turn in
your solutions with no penalty. However, you may use at most 2 on any
individual assignment. The whole point here is to give you some
flexibility that allows for things like illnesses, long trips, and the
like. I am unlikely to grant further extensions."

late_days_ila_v1: "You have each been allotted a *total* of *5* late
days. You may apply these to any homework assignment as you see fit,
with no penalty. However, you may use at most 2 on any individual
assignment. The whole point here is to give you some flexibility that
allows for things like illnesses, long trips, and the like. I am
unlikely to grant further extensions. Late days cannot be applied to
in-class assignments. Late assignments (beyond any applied late days)
will be subject to a half-letter grade reduction for every 0-24 hour
period that the assignment is late."
  
syllabus_deviation_v1: "This syllabus is subject to change based on
specific class needs, especially the
[schedule](#schedule). Significant deviations will be discussed in
class."

syllabus_deviation_v2: "This syllabus is subject to change based on
specific class needs, especially the
[schedule](#schedule). Significant deviations will be discussed in
class. Individual exceptions to the policies and schedule are granted
only in cases of true emergency. Please make arrangements with me if
an emergency arises."

cheating_v1: "Monmouth College's official policy on academic dishonesty can be found [here](http://ou.monmouthcollege.edu/life/residence-life/scots-guide/academic-regulations.aspx). **You** are responsible for reading and complying with that policy.<br/><br/>

*In this course, any violation of the academic honesty policy will
have varying consequences depending on the severity of the infraction
as judged by the instructor. Minimally, a violation will result in an
“F” or 0 points on the assignment in question. Additionally, the
student’s course grade may be lowered by one letter grade. In severe
cases, the student will be assigned a course grade of “F” and
dismissed from the class. All cases of academic dishonesty *must* be
reported to the Associate Dean who may decide to recommend further
action to the Admissions and Academic Status Committee, including
suspension or dismissal. It is assumed that students will educate
themselves regarding what is considered to be academic dishonesty, so
excuses or claims of ignorance will not mitigate the consequences of
any violations*"

collab_v1: "We encourage you to make use of the resources available
to you -- it is fine to seek help from a friend, tutor,
instructor, internet, etc. However, *copying of answers and
any act worthy of the label of \"cheating\" is never permissible*! It
is understandable that when you work with a partner or a group that
the resultant product is often extremely similar. This is acceptable
but be prepared to be asked to defend your collaborations to the
instructor. *You should always be able to reproduce an answer
on your own, and if you cannot you likely **do not really know
the material***.<br/><br/>

One way to collaborate effectively is to avoid taking careful notes
during a collaboration session. Discuss the material and sketch out
possible solutions on a whiteboard. When you have finished, take a
break and then write up your solutions without any help from notes or
pictures from the study session. This not only helps avoid violations
of academic dishonesty, it also improves your retention of the
material!<br/><br/>

When assignments are meant to be done in groups, you will be directed
to turn in one set of solutions per group. Otherwise, each student
must turn in an assignment representing their own work."

collab_v2: "We encourage you to make use of the resources available to
you -- it is fine to seek help from a friend, tutor, instructor,
internet, etc. However, *copying of answers and any act worth of the
label \"cheating\" is never permissible*! In addition to listing your
sources and collaborators, you should be producing your own writeup in
your own words. By \"your own words,\" we mean you should be producing
the text yourself, without some external aid. Verbatim copying of text
is specifically disallowed, but so is taking a source and rearranging
some phrases and changing some variable names to create a derivative
version! Such behavior is definitely NOT \"using your own words.\" It
does not matter if you helped contribute to this source text with
others, since then you are still not the sole author of the text.

The point of collaborating on an assignment is not to produce a
jointly authored set of solutions, since that violates the course
policies. Instead, it is to help you solve the problems, which
sometimes involve a bit of creativity. After you have jointly come up
with the ideas you need to solve the problems, though, you should part
ways with your group and sit down to do the writing by yourself.

I also advise against sharing the writeup you submit with others,
since if someone else uses your text as a source for their own
solution (with or without your permission), you will also be
implicated in the violation of the academic integrity policy. In any
case, if two nearly identical solutions are received, we have no way
of tell which is the original, and the policy is to not award credit
for either submission."

expectations_v1: |
  In short, I expect you to be respectful of others and take
  responsibility for your own learning. You are here to learn, so work
  hard and be professional.
  
    * Just attending class is not sufficient to truly learn the
    material. Read the text, use the resources available at Monmouth
    College, and go beyond the material.
    
    * If you miss class, you are responsible for everything covered on
   that day.  College is, in some sense, your job. Take pride in
   creating quality work. Staple your assignments, label problems, and
   present your answers neatly and orderly.

    * Your job is to convince me that you have learned the material --
      show your work! Even if you do not know a particular answer,
      guide me through your thought process.

zoom_v1: "If the instructor's video is turned on, yours should be,
too. Any computer, tablet, or phone usage should be directly related
to the course, e.g., Zoom or Socrative. Anything else is rude and
distracting to others. Inappropriate use of devices, or not turning
your video on, will result in a low participation grade."

electronics_v1: "Do not use your phone or other devices in class
except where necessary. Any computer or tablet usage should be related
to the course. If a device is not being used for Zoom or Socrative it
should be put away and turned on silent. Other usage is rude and
distracting to others."

gradescale_std_v1: |
  This courses uses a standard grading scale. Assignments and final
  grades will not be curved except in rare cases when its deemed
  necessary by the instructor. Percentage grades translate to letter
  grades as follows:

    |   Score | Grade     |
    | :-----: | :-------: |
    | 94--100 | A         |
    |  90--93 | A-        |
    |  88--89 | B+        |
    |  82--87 | B         |
    |  80--81 | B-        |
    |  78--79 | C+        |
    |  72--77 | C         |
    |  70--71 | C-        |
    |  68--69 | D+        |
    |  62--67 | D         |
    |  60--61 | D-        |
    |   0--59 | F         |

  You are always welcome to challenge a grade that you feel is unfair or
  calculated incorrectly. Mistakes made in your favor will never be
  corrected to lower your grade. Mistakes made not in your favor will
  be corrected. Basically, after the initial grading your score can
  only go up as the result of a challenge*.
