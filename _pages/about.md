I am an associate professor in the department of Mathematics,
Statistics, and Computer Science at [Monmouth
College](http://www.monmouthcollege.edu). I got my Ph.D. in Computer
Science from [Washington University in
St. Louis](http://www.wustl.edu) under [Kunal
Agrawal](http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~kunal/) and [Angelina
Lee](http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~angelee/) and my B.S. in mathematics
and computer science from [Truman State
University](http://www.truman.edu). My research involves both
theoretical and systems aspects of parallel computing, including
scheduling, runtime systems, and dynamic program analysis. I am also
interested in interdisciplinary data science, especially machine
learning for text analysis.
