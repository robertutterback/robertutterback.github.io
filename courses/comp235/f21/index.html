<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>An introduction to low-level programming and computer hardware
organization form a software perspective. The emphasis is on
understanding how application programmers can use knowledge of the
entire system to write better programs. Students will learn about data
representation, machine language, the memory hierarchy, and virtual
memory through programming assignments in C and assembly
language. Further topics may include processor architecture, code
optimization, and concurrency.</p>

<p>Basically, the aim of this course is to (1) convince students that no
magic is required to make computers work, and (2) help students
understand how hardware decisions can affect their programs.</p>

<h3 id="sources">Sources</h3>

<p>The course textbook will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bryant, Randal E. and O’Hallaron, Davir R.  <em>Computer Systems: A
Programmer’s Perspective</em>. 3rd Edition. Pearson. 2015. ISBN-13:
978-0134092669.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will also be using parts of <a href="https://diveintosystems.org/">Dive into
Systems</a>, a free, online textbook.</p>

<p>Since we will be using a lot of C, some of you may wish to have a more
in-depth reference manual. The following is pretty good:</p>

</ul>

<p>Other sources will be posted on this webpage as needed.</p>

<h3 id="topics">Topics</h3>

<p>The goal of this course is to produce programmers who understand how
the correctness and performance of their applications are impacted by
the compilation system, operating system, and hardware. After
dedicating some time to learning C, the course aims to cover the
majority of chapters 1-9 of the text.</p>

<h3 id="programming-environment">Programming Environment</h3>

<p>This course involves programming in both C and assembly language. All
necessary tools will be available on the department server. All
software for this course is available free of charge and can be found
on the web if students wish to install it on their personal
machines. The instructor cannot guarantee support for installing and
using other development environments.</p>

<h3 id="assignments-and-workload">Assignments and Workload</h3>
<p>The weekly workload for this course will vary by student and by week
but should be about 12 hours per week on average. The following table
provides a rough estimate of the distribution of time over different
course components for a 16 week semester, as well as detailing the
type, amount, and relative value of all assignments.</p>

<p>Each exam (midterm and final) focuses primarily, but not necessarily
exclusively, on material covered since the previous exam. In other
words, the final exam may include a few questions from first-half
material. The midterm and final are weighted equally (17.5% of your
final grade). Your lowest homework score will be dropped.</p>

<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>

<p>Your participation grade is based on a variety of activities. During
class I will often make use of the <a href="https://socrative.com">Socrative</a>
app, so you’ll need to install this on your phones. Participating in
Socrative questions and with in-class group activities is required for
a decent participation grade; an A includes asking questions either in
class or in office hours.</p>

<p>An additional portion of your participation grade is based on your
homework <em>presentations</em>. Every day that a homework assignment is due,
one or more students will be randomly selected to present their
solution to a portion of the assignment. You will be graded based on
<em>preparation</em> and the thoroughness of your explanations, NOT on
correctness, although you should of course strive for
correctness. Students taking late days will be required to leave the
classroom during these presentations. You must inform me <em>BEFORE</em>
class if you are taking late days to avoid being randomly selected to
present. Otherwise, if you are randomly selected to present but have
not done the assignment, you will receive a 0.</p>

<p>Your final grade is based on a weighted average of particular
assignment categories. You can estimate your current grade based on
your scores and these weights. You may always visit the instructor
outside of class to discuss your current standing. Assignments and
final grades use a standard grading scale shown below and will not
be curved except in rare cases when deemed necessary by the
instructor.</p>

<p>This courses uses a standard grading scale. Assignments and final
grades will not be curved except in rare cases when its deemed
necessary by the instructor. Percentage grades translate to letter

<p>You are always welcome to challenge a grade that you feel is unfair or
calculated incorrectly. Mistakes made in your favor will never be
corrected to lower your grade. Mistakes made not in your favor will
be corrected. Basically, after the initial grading your score can
only go up as the result of a challenge*.</p>

<h2 id="policies">Policies</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Late Assignments</strong>: You have each been allotted a <em>total</em> of <em>5</em> late days. You may apply these to any homework or programming assignment (NOT exams, labs, or reading assignments) you see fit and turn in your solutions with no penalty. Each late days gives you exactly 24 extra hours from the original due date and time. However, you may use <em>at most 2</em> late days on any individual assignment. The whole point here is to give you some flexibility that allows for things like illnesses, long trips, and the like. I am unlikely to grant further extensions. You must notify me if you will use late days, and how many, BEFORE the assignment is due. Late assignments (beyond any applied late days) will be subject to a grade reduction at my discretion. While you should expect a reasonable penalty for late work, know that I will NEVER give you a 0 for late work as long as it is turned in before the final exam.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Academic Dishonesty</strong>: Monmouth College’s official policy on academic dishonesty can be found <a href="http://ou.monmouthcollege.edu/life/residence-life/scots-guide/academic-regulations.aspx">here</a>. <strong>You</strong> are responsible for reading and complying with that policy.<br /><br />
<em>In this course, any violation of the academic honesty policy will have varying consequences depending on the severity of the infraction as judged by the instructor. Minimally, a violation will result in an “F” or 0 points on the assignment in question. Additionally, the student’s course grade may be lowered by one letter grade. In severe cases, the student will be assigned a course grade of “F” and dismissed from the class. All cases of academic dishonesty <strong>must</strong> be reported to the Associate Dean who may decide to recommend further action to the Admissions and Academic Status Committee, including suspension or dismissal. It is assumed that students will educate themselves regarding what is considered to be academic dishonesty, so excuses or claims of ignorance will not mitigate the consequences of any violations</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Collaboration</strong>: We encourage you to make use of the resources available to you – it is fine to seek help from a friend, tutor, instructor, internet, etc. However, <em>copying of answers and any act worthy of the label of “cheating” is never permissible</em>! It is understandable that when you work with a partner or a group that the resultant product is often extremely similar. This is acceptable but be prepared to be asked to defend your collaborations to the instructor. <em>You should always be able to reproduce an answer on your own, and if you cannot you likely <strong>do not really know the material</strong></em>.<br /><br />
One way to collaborate effectively is to avoid taking careful notes during a collaboration session. Discuss the material and sketch out possible solutions on a whiteboard. When you have finished, take a break and then write up your solutions without any help from notes or pictures from the study session. This not only helps avoid violations of academic dishonesty, it also improves your retention of the material!<br /><br />
When assignments are meant to be done in groups, you will be directed to turn in one set of solutions per group. Otherwise, each student must turn in an assignment representing their own work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Electronic Devices</strong>: Do not use your phone or other devices in class except where necessary. Any computer or tablet usage should be related to the course. If a device is not being used for Zoom or Socrative it should be put away and turned on silent. Other usage is rude and distracting to others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>General Expectations</strong>: In short, I expect you to be respectful of others and take
responsibility for your own learning. You are here to learn, so work
hard and be professional.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Just attending class is not sufficient to truly learn the
material. Read the text, use the resources available at Monmouth
College, and go beyond the material.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you miss class, you are responsible for everything covered on
 that day.  College is, in some sense, your job. Take pride in
 creating quality work. Staple your assignments, label problems, and
 present your answers neatly and orderly.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Your job is to convince me that you have learned the material –
show your work! Even if you do not know a particular answer,
guide me through your thought process.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
