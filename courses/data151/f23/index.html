<p>All resources used will be freely available online or provided to you.</p>

<h4 id="softwareaccounts">Software/Accounts</h4>

<p>There are several apps/accounts we will be using for this course.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>We will use the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/"><em>R</em> programming
language</a> through the <a href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/"><em>RStudio</em>
development
environment</a>. I
recommend students install this software on their own
machines. However, lab machines can be provided for student use if
necessary.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An account at <a href="https://runestone.academy">Runestone Academy</a>. Your

<h4 id="assignments-and-workload">Assignments and Workload</h4>

<p>The weekly workload for this course will vary by student and by week
but should be about 12.5 hours per week on average. The following
table provides a rough estimate of the distribution of time over
different course components for a 16 week semester, as well as
detailing the type, amount, and relative value of all assignments.</p>

<p><em>Exams</em>: All exams are weighted equally and will take approximately
the same amount of time. Exams will generally focus on material
covered since the previous exam but will be in some sense cumulative
due to the nature of programming. Unless stated otherwise, assume that
exams will be pencil and paper and that computers will not be
available during the exam period.</p>

<p><em>Projects</em>: One large-scale data analysis project will be undertaken
during the semester. These projects will be group efforts and will
require much more effort than the programs written in lab or as part
of homework. Some lab periods may be dedicated to work on the
project. It is highly recommend that all students make ample use of
the time given on these projects.</p>

<p><em>Labs</em>: Most weeks will include an in-class lab assignment. Students
will sometimes be placed into pairs for “paired programming”, a
programming practice where each member of the group takes turns typing
while the other group member helps look for typos, bugs, and otherwise
assists in the design of the code. Each group will submit their work
at the end of the lab period regardless of the overall completeness of
the assignment. The goal is to make good constructive progress on the
assignment. Full credit can and will be given on unfinished work so
long as it can be executed to complete some portion of the given task,
shows evidence of purposeful progress, and the group made full use of
the lab period.</p>

<p><em>Homework</em>: Students will be also be assigned homework problems during
some weeks. These problems are meant to guide reading, prepare the
student for in-class problems, and survey the material covered by the
exam. Each student will turn in their own set of solutions.</p>

<h4 id="grading">Grading</h4>

<p>Your final grade is based on a weighted average of particular
assignment categories. You can estimate your current grade based on
your scores and these weights. You may always visit the instructor
outside of class to discuss your current standing. Assignments and
final grades use a standard grading scale shown below and will not
be curved except in rare cases when deemed necessary by the
instructor.</p>

<p>This courses uses a standard grading scale. Assignments and final
grades will not be curved except in rare cases when its deemed
necessary by the instructor. Percentage grades translate to letter
grades as follows:</p>

<p>You are always welcome to challenge a grade that you feel is unfair or
calculated incorrectly. Mistakes made in your favor will never be
corrected to lower your grade. Mistakes made not in your favor will
be corrected. Basically, after the initial grading your score can
only go up as the result of a challenge*.</p>

<p>Lab and homework assignments are graded on a simple 3 point scale,
marked with (in decreasing order) a check-plus, check, or check
minus. Your final grade for these two assignment categories is then
based on the respective averages.</p>

<p>Your participation grade is based on a variety of activities, but
especially daily use of Socrative for in-class question and answer
sessions. Questions will cover portions of the text that were assigned
as reading and will range from simple checks to see if the reading was
done to more challenging questions that follow from a close
examination of the reading.  For the most part, the only requirement
is to provide an answer to every question and participate in the
resultant discussions. On occasion, questions will be evaluated for
their correctness and performance on 3 these questions will also
factor into the course participation grade. Students who do the
reading and start the homework as soon as possible will have very
little to worry about.</p>

<p>While there is no strict attendance policy, the course participation
grade is based in large part on engagement with socrative. Absent
students cannot participate in socrative sessions. Students should
avoid unexcused absences, as defined in the college-wide absence
policy. Whenever possible, let the instructor know of the absence
before it occurs. When unexcused absences do occur, it is the
student’s responsibility to make up for the lost class time and to
seek the permission of the instructor to hand-in or complete
assignments that are late due to an unexcused absence.</p>

<p>This course is designed around the assumption that students engage in
new ideas <em>before</em> they’re covered in class meetings. This means doing
assigned reading, taking a stab at homework problems, and as a result
coming to class and lab with some understand about a new idea or, just
as likely, with a host of questions about something encountered in the
reading and homework. Not attending class, skipping lab, and putting
off work to the point that an extension is needed are signs that a
student isn’t holding up their end of the bargain and is not prepared
to participate in class.</p>

<h3 id="policies">Policies</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Late assignments</strong>: You have each been allotted a <em>total</em> of <em>5</em> late days. You may apply these to any homework or programming assignment (NOT exams, labs, or reading assignments) you see fit and turn in your solutions with no penalty. Each late days gives you exactly 24 extra hours from the original due date and time. However, you may use <em>at most 2</em> late days on any individual assignment. The whole point here is to give you some flexibility that allows for things like illnesses, long trips, and the like. I am unlikely to grant further extensions. You must notify me if you will use late days, and how many, BEFORE the assignment is due. Late assignments (beyond any applied late days) will be subject to a grade reduction at my discretion. While you should expect a reasonable penalty for late work, know that I will NEVER give you a 0 for late work as long as it is turned in before the final exam. If you
must miss a lab, please contact me <strong>ahead of time</strong> to make
arrangements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Academic dishonesty</strong>: Monmouth College’s official policy on academic dishonesty can be found <a href="https://www.monmouthcollege.edu/offices/student-affairs/academic-regulations/">here</a>. <strong>You</strong> are responsible for reading and complying with that policy.<br /><br />
Note: Use of ChatGPT or similar AI tools is not allowed in this class. While such AI models can be effective tools, they should be utilized only in later courses, and only after a thorough discussion of their use.
<em>In this course, any violation of the academic honesty policy will have varying consequences depending on the severity of the infraction as judged by the instructor. Minimally, a violation will result in an “F” or 0 points on the assignment in question. Additionally, the student’s course grade may be lowered by one letter grade. In severe cases, the student will be assigned a course grade of “F” and dismissed from the class. All cases of academic dishonesty <strong>must</strong> be reported to the Associate Dean who may decide to recommend further action to the Admissions and Academic Status Committee, including suspension or dismissal. It is assumed that students will educate themselves regarding what is considered to be academic dishonesty, so excuses or claims of ignorance will not mitigate the consequences of any violations</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Collaboration</strong>: We encourage you to make use of the resources available to you – it is fine to seek help from a friend, tutor, instructor, internet, etc. However, <em>copying of answers and any act worth of the label “cheating” is never permissible</em>! In addition to listing your sources and collaborators, you should be producing your own writeup in your own words. By “your own words,” we mean you should be producing the text yourself, without some external aid. Verbatim copying of text is specifically disallowed, but so is taking a source and rearranging some phrases and changing some variable names to create a derivative version! Such behavior is definitely NOT “using your own words.” It does not matter if you helped contribute to this source text with others, since then you are still not the sole author of the text.
The point of collaborating on an assignment is not to produce a jointly authored set of solutions, since that violates the course policies. Instead, it is to help you solve the problems, which sometimes involve a bit of creativity. After you have jointly come up with the ideas you need to solve the problems, though, you should part ways with your group and sit down to do the writing by yourself.
I also advise against sharing the writeup you submit with others, since if someone else uses your text as a source for their own solution (with or without your permission), you will also be implicated in the violation of the academic integrity policy. In any case, if two nearly identical solutions are received, we have no way of tell which is the original, and the policy is to not award credit for either submission.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Electronic devices</strong>: Do not use your phone or other devices in class except where necessary. Any computer or tablet usage should be related to the course. If a device is not being used for Zoom or Socrative it should be put away and turned on silent. Other usage is rude and distracting to others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>General expectations</strong>: In short, I expect you to be respectful of others and take
responsibility for your own learning. You are here to learn, so work
hard and be professional.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Just attending class is not sufficient to truly learn the
material. Read the text, use the resources available at Monmouth
College, and go beyond the material.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you miss class, you are responsible for everything covered on
 that day.  College is, in some sense, your job. Take pride in
 creating quality work. Staple your assignments, label problems, and
 present your answers neatly and orderly.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Your job is to convince me that you have learned the material –
show your work! Even if you do not know a particular answer,
guide me through your thought process.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
