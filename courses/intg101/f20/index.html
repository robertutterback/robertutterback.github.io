<h2 id="content">Content</h2>

<h3 id="description">Description</h3>

<p>This seminar is required of all first year students and is taught by
faculty from a number of different disciplines. Theme-related texts in
the course raise basic questions about the variety of human
experience, and about personal and shared values and goals. You are
expected to think critically about issues raised, to participate in
discussions, and to write papers on the works studied.</p>

<h3 id="aim-and-goals">Aim and Goals</h3>

<p>Introduction to Liberal Arts (ILA) is a transition into the Monmouth College learning
community which values the spirit of inquiry in pursuit of academic
excellence.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Students will discover the liberal arts as a means to engage with
questions of human values, purposes, and communities and as a means to
explore connections among disciplines and diverse
perspectives. Students will learn that a liberal arts education can be
transformative, preparing them to pursue fulfilling personal and
professional lives.</li>
  <li>Students will understand key components for engaging in the
intellectual and personal challenges of college and for becoming
life-long learners. These components include developing a strong and
consistent work ethic, adopting an attitude of inquiry, functioning
from a growth-mindset, and approaching all aspects of the transition
to college with tenacity and resilience.</li>
  <li>Students will consider the dynamic relationships among Self,
Stranger, and Community and will discover that their own sense of self
and their engagement with the community affects their quality of life
and the lives of those around them.</li>
  <li>Students will understand that reading is an active process that
engages readers’ previous knowledge, requires attention to vocabulary
and structure, and involves analysis and questioning. Reading provides
a means to connect to ongoing conversations that can develop our
understanding of ourselves and our world and is a source of not only
learning, but also of enjoyment.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="required-materials">Required Materials</h3>

<p>The following texts should have been provided to you:</p>

<ul>

Opportunity of Education. Institute for Communication and
Leadership. (mailed to you)</li>
  <li>Baldwin, James. 1995. Going to Meet the Man. Vintage.</li>

</ul>

<p>Other sources will be posted on this webpage as needed.</p>

<p>In addition, you will need access to a computer or mobile with a
camera and microphone for accessing Zoom class discussions, viewing
online materials. A laptop/desktop computer is <strong>highly</strong> recommended
over a mobile device. For virtual classes (the majority), you should
have a text editor or word processor (e.g., Microsoft Word, Google
Docs) open for in-class writing activities. When we are together
in-person you may type on a laptop or write in a notebook (I suggest a
notebook – if we are outside there may be a glare).</p>

<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>

<h3 id="assignments-and-workload">Assignments and Workload</h3>
<p>The weekly workload for this course will vary by student and by week
but should be about <strong>12.3 hours per week on average</strong>. The following
table provides a rough estimate of the distribution of time over
different course components for a 16 week semester, as well as
detailing the type, amount, and relative value of all assignments.</p>

<p>There are two basic types of assignments: reading-based assessments
(45% of your grade) and experience-based writing (20% of your grade).</p>

<p>Your final grade is based on a weighted average of particular
assignment categories. You can estimate your current grade based on
your scores and these weights. You may always visit the instructor
outside of class to discuss your current standing. Assignments and
final grades use a standard grading scale shown below and will not be
curved except in rare cases when deemed necessary by the instructor.</p>

<p>No extra credit will be given on an individual basis.</p>

<h3 id="reading-based-assessments">Reading-based Assessments</h3>

<p>This is reading-focused course, so every day there will be reading
assignment and a quiz, homework question(s), or writing assignment
based on the reading. Examples include close-reading, annotation, or
weekly mini-essay assignments.</p>

<h3 id="experience-based-writing">Experience-based Writing</h3>

<p>Experience-based assignments are short written assignments about
outside (non-class) events, whether in person or virtual. You’ll be
expected to write a short reflection about the event and relate it to
the themes of the class. At various points during the semester you’ll
also be asked to reflect on your participation and what you have
learned about the liberal arts.</p>

<h3 id="final-exam">Final Exam</h3>

<p>At the end of the semester there will be an open-notes comprehensive
exam, worth 15% of your grade. This exam will be held remotely after
Thanksgiving break.</p>

<h3 id="participation">Participation</h3>

<p>This is a discussion-based class, so it is essential that you come
prepared to actively participate. This can take many forms, including:
regular class attendance, carefully reading and annotating the
assigned texts, sharing your thoughts, opinions, and insights during
discussions, considering and raising opposing viewpoints, engaging in
respectful dialogue with others, listening attentively to others’
perspectives, and following the discussion policies listed in the
policies section.</p>

<p>At various points I may make use of the
<a href="https://socrative.com">Socrative</a> app, so you’ll need to install this
on your phone. Participating in Socrative questions and with in-class
group activities is required for a decent participation grade.</p>

<h3 id="grade-scale">Grade Scale</h3>

<p>This courses uses a standard grading scale. Assignments and final
grades will not be curved except in rare cases when its deemed
necessary by the instructor. Percentage grades translate to letter
grades as follows:</p>

<p>You are always welcome to challenge a grade that you feel is unfair or
calculated incorrectly. Mistakes made in your favor will never be
corrected to lower your grade. Mistakes made not in your favor will
be corrected. Basically, after the initial grading your score can
only go up as the result of a challenge*.</p>

<h2 id="policies">Policies</h2>

<p>TLDR: I expect you to (1) be respectful of others, and (2) take
responsibility for your own learning. You are here to learn, so work
hard and be professional.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Attendance</strong>: You are allotted a total of <em>4</em> unexcused absences
without penalty to your grade. Beyond this your participation grade
will suffer heavily. College-sanctioned events may be excused from
this policy, but only to a point. If you feel you may miss more class
than this, contact Student Affairs who may then act on your behalf. In
the event of a prolonged campus closure (e.g., due to a pandemic),
further excused absences may be considered and other arrangements will
be made.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Late assignments</strong>: You have each been allotted a <em>total</em> of <em>5</em> late days. You may apply these to any homework assignment as you see fit, with no penalty. However, you may use at most 2 on any individual assignment. The whole point here is to give you some flexibility that allows for things like illnesses, long trips, and the like. I am unlikely to grant further extensions. Late days cannot be applied to in-class assignments. Late assignments (beyond any applied late days) will be subject to a half-letter grade reduction for every 0-24 hour period that the assignment is late.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Discussions</strong>: The goal of a discussion is to understand and learn
from the perspectives of others in order to better understand our
own beliefs and the world around us. Your participation is vital
both for your own learning experience and for those of your
classmates. Thus participation will be grade not only on quantity,
but on <em>quality</em>. You should respect individual differences and
viewpoints – you are allowed and encouraged to disagree with other
students, the professor, or the texts, but disagreement should
always be expressed in a respectful manner inside and outside of the
classroom (whether virtual or not).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Academic dishonesty</strong>: Monmouth College’s official policy on academic dishonesty can be found <a href="http://ou.monmouthcollege.edu/life/residence-life/scots-guide/academic-regulations.aspx">here</a>. <strong>You</strong> are responsible for reading and complying with that policy.<br><br>
<em>In this course, any violation of the academic honesty policy will have varying consequences depending on the severity of the infraction as judged by the instructor. Minimally, a violation will result in an “F” or 0 points on the assignment in question. Additionally, the student’s course grade may be lowered by one letter grade. In severe cases, the student will be assigned a course grade of “F” and dismissed from the class. All cases of academic dishonesty <strong>must</strong> be reported to the Associate Dean who may decide to recommend further action to the Admissions and Academic Status Committee, including suspension or dismissal. It is assumed that students will educate themselves regarding what is considered to be academic dishonesty, so excuses or claims of ignorance will not mitigate the consequences of any violations</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Citations</strong>: When writing, make it clear what text you are
discussing. This information can be included in the first sentence
of your written response, at the top of the page, or as part of your
response to a specific question. <strong>ALWAYS INCLUDE A PAGE NUMBER</strong>
with any information that is not yours. Signal when <em>any
information</em> comes from a specific page of a text rather than being
your original idea or personal observation/interpretation, whether
that comes in the form of a direct quote, paraphrase, or summary.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Electronic devices</strong>: Do not use your phone or other devices in class except where necessary. Any computer or tablet usage should be related to the course. If a device is not being used for Zoom or Socrative it should be put away and turned on silent. Other usage is rude and distracting to others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>COVID-19</strong>: If in-person class sessions are held, you are expected
to wear a mask and maintain appropriate social distance. Outside of
class, the college also expects these actions, in addition to
appropriate sanitizing practices, symptom tracking, and quarantining
as necessary. Even if you do not personally take the virus
seriously, you need to respect the learning environment of
others. For students uncomfortable or unable to attend due to
pandemic concerns, other arrangements will be made.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="schedule">Schedule</h2>
<p>The following <strong>tentative</strong> calendar should give you a feel for how
work is distributed throughout the semester. Assignments and events
are listed in the week they are due or when they occur. <em>This calendar
is subject to change based on the circumstances of the course</em>.</p>
