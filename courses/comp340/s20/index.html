<h3 id="content">Content</h3>

<p>The study of algorithms is one of the most crucial areas of in
Computer Science. In this course, students will learn the basic tools
of algorithm design and analysis through the study of some of the most
well known and important algorithms. By the end of the semester,
students will have developed not only a firm grounding in the analysis
and design of algorithms, but working knowledge of the algorithms that
have made computing what it is today.</p>

<p>There are too many algorithms topics to cover fully in a one semester
course. To compensate, students will complete an in-depth research
project on an algorithms-related topic of their choice, providing not
only further depth but also project management skills. While this
class focuses mostly on the theoretical design and analysis of
algorithms, students will have opportunities to implement algorithms
in the language of their choice.</p>

<h4 id="topics">Topics</h4>

<p>This course will emphasize the first nine chapters of the main text (TADM)
plus occasional material from other sources:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Basic Design and Analysis [TADM 1-2]</li>
  <li>Parallel Design and Analysis [other sources]</li>
  <li>Standard Data Structures [TADM 3]</li>
  <li>Sorting and Searching [TADM 4]</li>
  <li>Graph Traversal [TADM 5]</li>
  <li>Weighed Graph Algorithms [TADM 6]</li>
  <li>Parallel Graph Algorithms [other sources]</li>
  <li>Combinatorial Search &amp; Heuristics [TADM 7]</li>
  <li>Dynamic Programming [TADM 8]</li>
  <li>Intractable Problems [TADM 9]</li>
</ul>

<p>Time permitting, we’ll explore more advanced topics, such as
probabilistic or approximation algorithms.</p>

<h4 id="sources">Sources</h4>

<p>The required course textbook is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Skiena, Steven S. <em>The Algorithm Design Manual</em>. Second
Editions. Springer. London. 2012.  ISBN-13: 978-1-84800-069-8</li>
</ul>

<p>We will occasionally pull material from other sources, especially for
parallel algorithms. Any required readings will be posted on this
webpage as needed.</p>

<p>I encourage you to take advantage of the wealth of algorithms study
resources that can be found online. This material can be difficult;
exposure to multiple sources is always useful and sometimes necessary
to fully grasp it. I will list here some resources that may be useful
(and fun!). Please suggest links to add as you find them.</p>

<h4 id="assignments-and-workload">Assignments and Workload</h4>

<p>The weekly workload for this course will vary by student and over the
semester, but on average should be about 13 hours per week. The follow
table provides a rough estimate of the distribution of this time over
different course components for a 16 week semester.</p>

<p>Generally problem sets and quizzes will alternate weeks. There will be
a research project on any algorithms-related topic, culminating in a
paper and presentation to the class. There are two exams – a midterm
and a final – both worth 10% each. The final exam will focus
primarily, but not exclusively, on material covered since the
midterm. In other words, it will contain a few questions on material
from the first half of the semester.</p>

<h4 id="grading">Grading</h4>

<p>Your participation grade is based on a variety of activities. During
class I will often make use of the <a href="https://socrative.com">Socrative</a>
app, so you’ll need to install this on your phones. Participating in
Socrative questions and with in-class group activities is required for
a decent participation grade; an A includes asking questions either in
class or in office hours.</p>

<p>Your final grade is based on a weighted average of particular
assignment categories, with weights shown above. You can estimate your
current grade based on your scores and these weights. You may always
visit the instructor <em>outside of class</em> to discuss your current
standing. Assignments and final grades use a standard grading scale
shown below and will not be curved except in rare cases when deemed
necessary by the instructor.</p>

<p>This courses uses a standard grading scale. Assignments and final
grades will not be curved except in rare cases when its deemed
necessary by the instructor. Percentage grades translate to letter
grades as follows:</p>

<p>You are always welcome to challenge a grade that you feel is unfair or
calculated incorrectly. Mistakes made in your favor will never be
corrected to lower your grade. Mistakes made not in your favor will
be corrected. Basically, after the initial grading your score can
only go up as the result of a challenge*.</p>

<h3 id="policies">Policies</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Late assignments</strong>: You have each been allotted a <em>total</em> of <em>5</em> late days. You may apply these to any problem sets you see fit and turn in your solutions with no penalty. However, you may use at most 2 on any individual assignment. The whole point here is to give you some flexibility that allows for things like illnesses, long trips, and the like. I am unlikely to grant further extensions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Academic dishonesty</strong>: Monmouth College’s official policy on academic dishonesty can be found <a href="http://ou.monmouthcollege.edu/life/residence-life/scots-guide/academic-regulations.aspx">here</a>. <strong>You</strong> are responsible for reading and complying with that policy.<br><br>
<em>In this course, any violation of the academic honesty policy will have varying consequences depending on the severity of the infraction as judged by the instructor. Minimally, a violation will result in an “F” or 0 points on the assignment in question. Additionally, the student’s course grade may be lowered by one letter grade. In severe cases, the student will be assigned a course grade of “F” and dismissed from the class. All cases of academic dishonesty <strong>must</strong> be reported to the Associate Dean who may decide to recommend further action to the Admissions and Academic Status Committee, including suspension or dismissal. It is assumed that students will educate themselves regarding what is considered to be academic dishonesty, so excuses or claims of ignorance will not mitigate the consequences of any violations</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Collaboration</strong>: We encourage you to make use of the resources available to you – it is fine to seek help from a friend, tutor, instructor, internet, etc. However, <em>copying of answers and any act worth of the label “cheating” is never permissible</em>! In addition to listing your sources and collaborators, you should be producing your own writeup in your own words. By “your own words,” we mean you should be producing the text yourself, without some external aid. Verbatim copying of text is specifically disallowed, but so is taking a source and rearranging some phrases and changing some variable names to create a derivative version! Such behavior is definitely NOT “using your own words.” It does not matter if you helped contribute to this source text with others, since then you are still not the sole author of the text.
The point of collaborating on an assignment is not to produce a jointly authored set of solutions, since that violates the course policies. Instead, it is to help you solve the problems, which sometimes involve a bit of creativity. After you have jointly come up with the ideas you need to solve the problems, though, you should part ways with your group and sit down to do the writing by yourself.
I also advise against sharing the writeup you submit with others, since if someone else uses your text as a source for their own solution (with or without your permission), you will also be implicated in the violation of the academic integrity policy. In any case, if two nearly identical solutions are received, we have no way of tell which is the original, and the policy is to not award credit for either submission.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Electronic devices</strong>: Do not use your phone or other devices in class except where necessary. Any computer or tablet usage should be related to the course. If a device is not being used for Zoom or Socrative it should be put away and turned on silent. Other usage is rude and distracting to others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>General expectations</strong>: In short, I expect you to be respectful of others and take
responsibility for your own learning. You are here to learn, so work
hard and be professional.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Just attending class is not sufficient to truly learn the
material. Read the text, use the resources available at Monmouth
College, and go beyond the material.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you miss class, you are responsible for everything covered on
 that day.  College is, in some sense, your job. Take pride in
 creating quality work. Staple your assignments, label problems, and
 present your answers neatly and orderly.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Your job is to convince me that you have learned the material –
show your work! Even if you do not know a particular answer,
guide me through your thought process.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
