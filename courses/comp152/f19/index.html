					<h1 class="post-title">COMP 152: Object-Oriented Data Structures and Algorithms, Fall 2019</h1>
					<!-- <h5 class="class-description">A continuation of COMP 151 that explores the essential data structures and algorithms of modern computing, including lists, stacks, queues, heaps, and trees. Students will design, analyze, and build programs that implement and utilize these data structures to solve computational problems, including a thorough survey of sorting and search algorithms. These theoretical constructs are complemented by exposure to good software development practices, including data abstraction via abstract data types and object-oriented software design. Strong emphasis is put on analyzing and evaluating how implementation choices made by the programmer impact overall program performance and maintainability.</h5> -->

<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>Data structures continues the study of abstraction and programming
through a focused study of data structures, algorithms, and abstract
data types. The primary focus of this course is the design and
development of algorithms and programs using data abstraction and
information hiding via abstract data types <em>ADTs</em>. Data abstraction
is absolutely fundamental to good programming practice and the
management of large scale problems and data sets. This course is
designed to round out a student’s understanding of basic computer
science concepts while strengthening the program design and
development skills through continued use of an object-oriented design
methodology.</p>

<p>It is imperative that programmers and program designers be able to
determine which of the many solutions available is the best for their
specific task. Throughout the course, students will focus on to making
solid quantitative and qualitative judgments about program efficiency
and overall program design choices. Gone are the days when “it
works” is a good enough assessment for the quality of a program.</p>

<p>Students will explore the ideas and concepts brought up in class and
homework assignments during the weekly lab session. In addition to
hands on exercises, lab sessions will be used to explore current,
relevant research in computer science.</p>

<h4 id="sources">Sources</h4>

<p>The course textbook will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Goodrich, Michael T. and Tamassia, Robert and Goldwasser, Michael H. <em>Data Structures and Algorithms in Python</em>. Wiley. 2013. ISBN-13:
978-1-118-29027-9.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other sources will be posted on this webpage as needed.</p>

<h4 id="topics">Topics</h4>

<p>The course aims to cover chapters 1-8, parts of chapters 9-10,
chapter 12, and parts of chapter 14 of the text. This includes, but is
not limited to:</p>

<h4 id="programming-environment">Programming Environment</h4>

<p>This course uses Python 3 and <a href="repl.it">repl.it</a>, an online IDE
service. Students will receive, complete, and submit assignments all
via the website. Students can also complete assignments on their local
machines (I recommend the <a href="https://www.anaconda.com">Anaconda</a>
software package) or on the departmental server, but all assignment
submissions must be done through <a href="repl.it">repl.it</a> unless otherwise
specified.</p>

<h3 id="assessment">Assessment</h3>

<h4 id="assignments-and-workload">Assignments and Workload</h4>
<p>The weekly workload for this course will vary by student and by week
but should be about 14 hours per week on average. The following table
provides a rough estimate of the distribution of time over different
course components for a 16 week semester, as well as detailing the
type, amount, and relative value of all assignments.</p>

<p>Homework assignments will always either precede a lab to prepare for
it or follow a lab to complete it. Each exam will focus primarily, but
not necessarily exclusively, on the material covered since the
previous exam.</p>

<h4 id="grading">Grading</h4>
<p>Lab and homework assignments are graded on a simple 3 point scale,
marked with (in decreasing order) a check-plus, check, or check
minus. Your final grade for these two assignment categories is then
based on the respective averages.</p>

<p>Your participation grade is based on a variety of activities. During
class I will often make use of the <a href="https://socrative.com">Socrative</a>
app, so you’ll need to install this on your phones. Participating in
Socrative questions and with in-class group activities is required for
a decent participation grade; an A includes asking questions either in
class or in office hours.</p>

<p>Your final grade is based on a weighted average of particular
assignment categories. You can estimate your current grade based on
your scores and these weights. You may always visit the instructor
outside of class to discuss your current standing. Assignments and
final grades use a standard grading scale shown below and will not
be curved except in rare cases when deemed necessary by the
instructor.</p>

<p>This courses uses a standard grading scale. Assignments and final
grades will not be curved except in rare cases when its deemed
necessary by the instructor. Percentage grades translate to letter

<p>You are always welcome to challenge a grade that you feel is unfair or
calculated incorrectly. Mistakes made in your favor will never be
corrected to lower your grade. Mistakes made not in your favor will
be corrected. Basically, after the initial grading your score can
only go up as the result of a challenge*.</p>

<h3 id="policies">Policies</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Late assignments</strong>: In general, late assignments will <em>not</em> be accepted. Exceptions may be made only for situations beyond your control. If you feel your reason is justified, schedule a meeting with the instructor to plead your case.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Academic dishonesty</strong>: Monmouth College’s official policy on academic dishonesty can be found <a href="http://ou.monmouthcollege.edu/life/residence-life/scots-guide/academic-regulations.aspx">here</a>. <strong>You</strong> are responsible for reading and complying with that policy.<br><br>
<em>In this course, any violation of the academic honesty policy will have varying consequences depending on the severity of the infraction as judged by the instructor. Minimally, a violation will result in an “F” or 0 points on the assignment in question. Additionally, the student’s course grade may be lowered by one letter grade. In severe cases, the student will be assigned a course grade of “F” and dismissed from the class. All cases of academic dishonesty <strong>must</strong> be reported to the Associate Dean who may decide to recommend further action to the Admissions and Academic Status Committee, including suspension or dismissal. It is assumed that students will educate themselves regarding what is considered to be academic dishonesty, so excuses or claims of ignorance will not mitigate the consequences of any violations</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Collaboration</strong>: We encourage you to make use of the resources available to you – it is fine to seek help from a friend, tutor, instructor, internet, etc. However, <em>copying of answers and any act worthy of the label of “cheating” is never permissible</em>! It is understandable that when you work with a partner or a group that the resultant product is often extremely similar. This is acceptable but be prepared to be asked to defend your collaborations to the instructor. <em>You should always be able to reproduce an answer on your own, and if you cannot you likely <strong>do not really know the material</strong></em>.<br><br>
One way to collaborate effectively is to avoid taking careful notes during a collaboration session. Discuss the material and sketch out possible solutions on a whiteboard. When you have finished, take a break and then write up your solutions without any help from notes or pictures from the study session. This not only helps avoid violations of academic dishonesty, it also improves your retention of the material!<br><br>
When assignments are meant to be done in groups, you will be directed to turn in one set of solutions per group. Otherwise, each student must turn in an assignment representing their own work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Electronic devices</strong>: Do not use your phone or other devices in class except where necessary. Any computer or tablet usage should be related to the course. If a device is not being used for Zoom or Socrative it should be put away and turned on silent. Other usage is rude and distracting to others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>General expectations</strong>: In short, I expect you to be respectful of others and take
responsibility for your own learning. You are here to learn, so work
hard and be professional.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Just attending class is not sufficient to truly learn the
material. Read the text, use the resources available at Monmouth
College, and go beyond the material.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you miss class, you are responsible for everything covered on
 that day.  College is, in some sense, your job. Take pride in
 creating quality work. Staple your assignments, label problems, and
 present your answers neatly and orderly.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Your job is to convince me that you have learned the material –
show your work! Even if you do not know a particular answer,
guide me through your thought process.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
