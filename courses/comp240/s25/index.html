<h3 id="description">Description</h3>

<p>In this course, students will work in small groups to develop three
different computer applications. Each application will expose them to
a different computing platform along with the tools and computing
concepts used in developing programs for that platform. The platform
and purpose of each applications will vary from year to year and
instructor to instructor, but common choices of platforms include: the
command line interface, the web, mobile devices, and high-performance
computing. Students will maintain and develop their projects using
GitHub and Git version control software. Emphasis will be placed on
building effective software development teams as well as building the
software itself. Upon completing the course students will know how to
apply basic software engineering practices in a small group setting,
how to maintain software through the git version control system, and
will have experience with tools and best-practices for developing
modern software applications for three different computing platforms.</p>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="sources">Sources</h3>

<p>Books and reference materials will be based on projects assigned but
are likely to be a combination of online resources and instructor
provided handouts. As part of their projects students will learn to
seek out and work with reference material for programming tools and
languages in addition to textbooks.</p>

<h3 id="software">Software</h3>

<p>Every project will use <code>git</code> and GitHub for collaboration and version
control. You will need to <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">download <code>git</code>
itself</a>. This can be used via the
command line or simply within any of the integrated development
environments we will be using. You may also choose to install a
third-party graphical client such as <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub
Desktop</a>.</p>

<p>We will use <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> for repository hosting and
project management. You will need to create a GitHub account if you
don’t already have one.</p>

<p>Beyond those, each project will use different software. We will
discuss installation and use of all software (including <code>git</code> and
GitHub) during class time.</p>

<h2 id="policies">Policies</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Late assignments</strong>: In general, late assignments will <em>not</em> be accepted. Exceptions may be made only for situations beyond your control. If you feel your reason is justified, schedule a meeting with the instructor to plead your case.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Academic dishonesty</strong>: Monmouth College’s official policy on academic dishonesty can be found <a href="http://ou.monmouthcollege.edu/life/residence-life/scots-guide/academic-regulations.aspx">here</a>. <strong>You</strong> are responsible for reading and complying with that policy.<br /><br />
<em>In this course, any violation of the academic honesty policy will have varying consequences depending on the severity of the infraction as judged by the instructor. Minimally, a violation will result in an “F” or 0 points on the assignment in question. Additionally, the student’s course grade may be lowered by one letter grade. In severe cases, the student will be assigned a course grade of “F” and dismissed from the class. All cases of academic dishonesty <strong>must</strong> be reported to the Associate Dean who may decide to recommend further action to the Admissions and Academic Status Committee, including suspension or dismissal. It is assumed that students will educate themselves regarding what is considered to be academic dishonesty, so excuses or claims of ignorance will not mitigate the consequences of any violations</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>General expectations</strong>: In short, I expect you to be respectful of others and take
responsibility for your own learning. You are here to learn, so work
hard and be professional.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Just attending class is not sufficient to truly learn the
material. Read the text, use the resources available at Monmouth
College, and go beyond the material.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you miss class, you are responsible for everything covered on
 that day.  College is, in some sense, your job. Take pride in
 creating quality work. Staple your assignments, label problems, and
 present your answers neatly and orderly.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Your job is to convince me that you have learned the material –
show your work! Even if you do not know a particular answer,
guide me through your thought process.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>

<h3 id="assignments-and-workload">Assignments and Workload</h3>

<p>The weekly workload for this course will vary by student and by week
but should be about 10 hours per week on average. The following

different course components for a 16 week semester, as well as
detailing the type, amount, and relative value of all assignments.</p>

<p>You can expect to spend most class meetings checking in with your
current development team and the course instructor. Accompanying each
project there will typically be four presentations: three (sometimes
four) checkpoint presentations and one final presentation. These
presentations will take place during scheduled class times.</p>

<h4 id="in-class-participation">In-Class Participation</h4>

<p>Your in-class participation score will be judged based on (1) your
frequency of unexcused absences, and (2) your active engagement and
collaboration with your team: asking or answering questions,
contributing ideas, doing research, etc.</p>

<h4 id="evaluations">Evaluations</h4>

<p>After each final presentation, you will submit three kinds of evaluations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Project evaluation: an evaluation of each member’s contributions and
of how well the team worked together overall, and a reflection on
your own contributions and how you can better contribute</li>
  <li>Peer evaluation: an evaluation of other teams’ final presentation</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="projects">Projects</h4>

<p>Detailed information about the projects can be found <a href="proj">here</a>,
with additional instructions provided on a per-project basis.</p>

<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>

<p>Your individual project and presentation grades will be determined
based on the overall group effort as well as your individual
contributions to the application. Individual contributions will be
assessed throughthe project tracking features on GitHub, through
feedback provided by peer-reviews done about your work, and through
your own self-evaluations. It will not necessarily be the case that
each member of a group receive the same grade on a project or
presentation. <strong><a href="proj">More information about project grading can be found
here</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Your final grade is based on a weighted average of particular
assignment categories. You can estimate your current grade based on
your scores and these weights. You may always visit the instructor
outside of class to discuss your current standing. Assignments and
final grades use a standard grading scale shown below and will not
be curved except in rare cases when deemed necessary by the
instructor.</p>

<p>This courses uses a standard grading scale. Assignments and final
grades will not be curved except in rare cases when its deemed
necessary by the instructor. Percentage grades translate to letter
grades as follows:</p>
