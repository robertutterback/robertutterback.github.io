  </header>

	<article class="post-content COMP240 - Project 3: Baseball Dashboard clearfix">
		<p>For our third project you’ll be developing a web-based dashboard to
visualize and analyze baseball data. This dashboard will serve as an
interactive tool to explore various statistics and trends within the
dataset provided. The backend of the application must be implemented
in Python, while you have the freedom to choose the technologies used
for the frontend and data visualization components.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: I realize not everyone is familiar with baseball. You do NOT
need to become an expert in baseball to do this project. There is
enough flexibility in the requirements that you can learn a few things
about baseball and still ask/answer some very interesting questions
about the data. <em>Many</em> data scientists start a new job knowing NOTHING
about their dataset, so this is pretty typical, and is an opportunity
to learn how to extract and present interesting insights from any
dataset. This will prepare you for real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>As in the first two projects, we will continue to challenge your
programming skills while building on your ability to work in a team,
use version control effectively, and apply an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile
development</a>
methodology.</p>

<h2 id="learning-goals">Learning Goals</h2>

workflow</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Independent learning and problem-solving skills</li>
  <li>Continue practicing presentation skills</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-dataset-lahmans-baseball-database">The Dataset: Lahman’s Baseball Database</h2>

<p>The project will utilize Lahman’s Baseball Database, a comprehensive
dataset containing historical baseball data. This dataset includes
player performance statistics, team data, batting and pitching
statistics, and more, spanning from 1871 to 2022. You will have access
to a PostgreSQL database containing this information.</p>

<h3 id="key-components-of-the-dataset">Key Components of the Dataset</h3>

<ul>
  <li>People: Player names, birth dates, and biographical info.</li>
  <li>Batting: Batting statistics for players.</li>
  <li>Pitching: Pitching statistics for players.</li>
  <li>Teams: Yearly stats and information for each team.</li>
  <li>Awards: Player awards (e.g., MVP, Cy Young).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="querying-the-data">Querying the Data</h3>

<p>I will email you the access information necessary to access the
database. You may NOT use other forms of the Lahman database — you
MUST use SQL to retrieve the data from my database. You may, however,
add other baseball datasets, in whatever format you choose, if you’re
feeling ambitious.</p>

<p>You will need to learn SQL to query the data. There are many online
resources available, including <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/">W3
Schools</a>,
<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/sql">Codecademy</a>, and the
free, interactive book <a href="https://selectstarsql.com/">Select Star SQL</a>.</p>

<p>The baseball data is split up into <em>tables</em>. To ask and answer
interesting questions, you will need to <strong>join</strong> some of these tables
together. This will likely be the hardest aspect of SQL you’ll need to
learn. See more about joins
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join.asp">here</a> and
<a href="https://selectstarsql.com/hiatuses.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Although SQL is the query language, you will need to use this from
WITHIN Python. I highly recommend using the Python module psycopg2 as
an “adapter” to the database, SQLAlchemy to run your queries, and
Pandas for data manipulation.</p>

<h2 id="dashboard-technologies">Dashboard Technologies</h2>

<p>You are required to build a web-based dashboard, as opposed to a
native desktop or mobile app. Unlike last project’s website, this app
requires both a “front” end (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) and a “back” end
that retrieves the data and perhaps does some processing. <em>Your
backend MUST be in Python</em>.</p>

<p>Other than that, you are free to choose what your dashboard will be
built with. In fact, research different technologies is one of the
learning goals for this project! There are some Python libraries made
specifically for dashboards. There are many others made for websites,
and you can build dashboards on top of them.</p>

<p>Here are a few libraries to help you start your search:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://dash.plotly.com/">Plotly Dash</a> is made for
dashboards. Under the hood it uses Plotly to create visualizes and
Flask as the web serving software.</li>
  <li><a href="https://panel.holoviz.org/">Panel</a> is also made for dashboards, and
is built off of Bokeh.</li>
  <li><a href="https://streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a> is a new library that is easy to
build with. It <em>seems</em> less flexible than the other choices, but I
don’t have any direct experience with it, so I may be wrong.</li>
  <li><a href="http://bokeh.org/">Bokeh</a> is a plotting library and server, though
it is a bit more “low-level” than something like Panel.</li>
  <li><a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/">Flask</a> is a general
purpose web framework. You can build any kind of website with it. It
is very flexible, though you’ll need to have some other
visualization packages to create your visualizations.</li>
</ul>

<a href="https://pyviz.org/dashboarding/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="agile-development-and-github-usage">Agile Development and GitHub Usage</h2>

<p>As before, you are expected to adopt an Agile development methodology
for this project. Plan your work in one-week sprints, create user
stories, maintain a backlog of tasks, estimate the difficulty of tasks
and keep track of your velocity.</p>

<p>User GitHub for version control, collaborating on code through feature
branches and pull requests. I should see pull requests from everyone,
as well as comments on those pull requests that serve as code reviews.</p>

<h2 id="weekly-checkpoints-and-requirements">Weekly Checkpoints and Requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Week 1</strong>: You need to accomplish two separate tasks during this week:
    <ul>
      <li>Research technologies and build a basic prototype or toy
dashboard. It’s fine to follow an online tutorial to do this. You
might even build multiple toy dashboards to get a feel for which
dashboard/visualization technology you like best.</li>
      <li>Begin learning SQL and exploring the dataset. You should be able
to retrieve part of the dataset from Python.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Week 2: Integrate week 1’s two pieces so that the dashboard shows
  some baseball information. Focus on simple things, like showing
  descriptive analytics.</li>
  <li>Week 3: Expand the dashboard to include interactive, exploratory
visualizations. The user should be able to filter or subset parts of
the data. Refine the user interface and user experience based on
feedback.</li>
  <li>Week 4: Attempt to incorporate a descriptive model into the
dashboard. Prepare for the final presentation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that there are no specific required visualizations or questions
to answer — it’s up to you! Imagine that you work for a baseball
executive in the 90s, before analytics was a big part of
baseball. What might be interesting and useful to them? <strong>This is
actually the hardest part of the job for any data analyst or data
scientist: figuring out what will help your company’s decision makers,
even though they don’t even know!</strong></p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-descriptive-model">What is a “Descriptive Model”</h3>

<p>For week 4 above I mentioned you need a descriptive model. A
descriptive model aims to summarize or describe the main features of a
dataset of the relationships between variables within it. Unlike
predictive models, which forecast unobserved outcomes or future
trends, descriptive models focus on presenting the current data in a
manner that is easy to understand, highlighting patterns, trends, and
relationships that are already present in the dataset.</p>

<p>In the context of this project, a descriptive model could involve:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Correlation Analysis</strong>: Probably the most expected
form. Identifying and quantifying the relationships between
variables. For instance, exploring how batting average correlates
with runs batted in (RBIs) or home runs.</li>
  <li><strong>Trend Analysis</strong>: Looking at how certain metrics (e.g., player
performance, team wins) change over time. For example, how has power
hitting or base stealing changed since the 1980s?</li>
  <li><strong>Segmentation and Clustering</strong>: Grouping similar data points
together to identify distinct categories within the data. For
example, categorizing pitchers into different roles based on their
performance statistics.</li>
</ul>

<p>Normally, summary statistics would also count as a descriptive model,
but that is too simple for your last week; I expect summary statistics
to be implemented earlier.</p>

<p>You will probably need some additional Python libraries, such as
<a href="https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html">statsmodels</a> or
<a href="https://scikit-learn.org">scikit-learn</a> to implement such a model.</p>

<h2 id="presentations">Presentations</h2>

<p>As before, you’ll have weekly checkpoint presentations. The
requirements for those are unchanged; please see project 2’s
description of them.</p>

<p>Your final presentation will be similar, but I want you to start the
presentation as if you are presenting to a baseball executive. Demo
your dashboard, explain why it’s useful and what questions it can
answer, without using technical jargon. Then, for the rest of the
presentation, target intro programming students and include the rest
of the final presentation components mentioned in project 2.</p>
