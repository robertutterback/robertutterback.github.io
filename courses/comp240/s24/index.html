<h2 id="content">Content</h2>

<h3 id="description">Description</h3>

<p>In this course, students will work in small groups to develop three
different computer applications. Each application will expose them to
a different computing platform along with the tools and computing
concepts used in developing programs for that platform. The platform
and purpose of each applications will vary from year to year and
instructor to instructor, but common choices of platforms include: the
command line interface, the web, mobile devices, and high-performance
computing. Students will maintain and develop their projects using
GitHub and Git version control software. Emphasis will be placed on
building effective software development teams as well as building the
software itself. Upon completing the course students will know how to
apply basic software engineering practices in a small group setting,
how to maintain software through the git version control system, and
will have experience with tools and best-practices for developing
modern software applications for three different computing platforms.</p>

<h3 id="sources">Sources</h3>

<p>Books and reference materials will be based on projects assigned but
are likely to be a combination of online resources and instructor
provided handouts. As part of their projects students will learn to
seek out and work with reference material for programming tools and
languages in addition to textbooks.</p>

<h3 id="software">Software</h3>

<p>Every project will use <code>git</code> and GitHub for collaboration and version
control. If you are familiar with the command line you may prefer to
simply use the <code>git</code> command; otherwise you should install a graphical
client. You will need to <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">download
<code>git</code>itself</a>. Although it comes with a
basic graphical client, you may prefer to install a third-party
client; <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a> will suit our
needs, although you may choose whichever you wish.</p>

<h2 id="policies">Policies</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Late assignments</strong>: In general, late assignments will <em>not</em> be accepted. Exceptions may be made only for situations beyond your control. If you feel your reason is justified, schedule a meeting with the instructor to plead your case.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Academic dishonesty</strong>: Monmouth College’s official policy on academic dishonesty can be found <a href="http://ou.monmouthcollege.edu/life/residence-life/scots-guide/academic-regulations.aspx">here</a>. <strong>You</strong> are responsible for reading and complying with that policy.<br /><br />
<em>In this course, any violation of the academic honesty policy will have varying consequences depending on the severity of the infraction as judged by the instructor. Minimally, a violation will result in an “F” or 0 points on the assignment in question. Additionally, the student’s course grade may be lowered by one letter grade. In severe cases, the student will be assigned a course grade of “F” and dismissed from the class. All cases of academic dishonesty <strong>must</strong> be reported to the Associate Dean who may decide to recommend further action to the Admissions and Academic Status Committee, including suspension or dismissal. It is assumed that students will educate themselves regarding what is considered to be academic dishonesty, so excuses or claims of ignorance will not mitigate the consequences of any violations</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>General expectations</strong>: In short, I expect you to be respectful of others and take
responsibility for your own learning. You are here to learn, so work
hard and be professional.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Just attending class is not sufficient to truly learn the
material. Read the text, use the resources available at Monmouth
College, and go beyond the material.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you miss class, you are responsible for everything covered on
 that day.  College is, in some sense, your job. Take pride in
 creating quality work. Staple your assignments, label problems, and
 present your answers neatly and orderly.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Your job is to convince me that you have learned the material –
show your work! Even if you do not know a particular answer,
guide me through your thought process.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>

<h3 id="assignments-and-workload">Assignments and Workload</h3>

<p>The weekly workload for this course will vary by student and by week
but should be about 12-13 hours per week on average. The following
table provides a rough estimate of the distribution of time over
different course components for a 16 week semester, as well as
detailing the type, amount, and relative value of all assignments.</p>

<p>You can expect to spend most class meetings checking in with your
current development team and the course instructor. Accompanying each
project there will be four presentations: three checkpoint
presentations and one final presentation with an application
demo. These presentations will take place during scheduled class
times.</p>

<!-- You will carry out peer-reviews and self-evaluations after each
presentation. -->

<h4 id="presentations">Presentations</h4>

<p>Presentations should cover at least four topics:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Where we are</em>: A demonstration of the current state of the project.</li>
  <li><em>How we got here</em>: A presentation of the technical details as well
as how the group worked together to get the project to its current
state.</li>
  <li><em>Group <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis">SWOT
analysis</a></em>: In terms
of the work presented, what were your group strengths and
weaknesses? What opportunities do you have to move things forward
for the next push? What threatens your progress?</li>
  <li><em>What’s next?</em>: What do you plan to accomplish by the next
checkpoint presentation? How will you achieve that goal given items
identified by your SWOT analysis?</li>
</ol>

<p>A clear-headed analysis of your group’s effectiveness is equally as
important as progress on the code. Your group should be clearly
working together to pursue a shared goal, helping one another, and
generally exploring the ways in which <strong>how you work as a group</strong>
impacts your progress.</p>

<p>Presetnations should consist of a short slide deck as well as live
demos of features and/or GitHub.</p>

<h4 id="projects">Projects</h4>

<p>Projects are a group effort. You’ll be called on both individually and
as a group to evaluate your projects in two ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Technical</em>: Does it have a clear set of program features? Are they
relatively bug free or at least free of unknown and undocumented
bugs? Is the code well-reasoned and technically sound or more like
“spray and pray” logic?</li>
  <li><em>Group Effectiveness</em>: Did the group collaborate and work together
or were individuals working largely in a vacuum? Is there clear
evidence of efforts to improve group cohesion and effectiveness? Is
there a solid sense of shared ownership and understanding for all
parts of the project?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>

<p>Your individual project and presentation grades will be determined
based on the overall group effort as well as your individual
contributions to the application. Individual contributions will be
assessed throughthe project tracking features on GitHub/GitLab,
through feedback provided by peer-reviews done about your work, and
through your own self-evaluations. It will not necessarily be the case
that each member of a group receive the same grade on a project or
presentation. Participation grades will be determined by class
attendance, contributions to discussions on GitHub/GitLab, and through
the quality of your peer-reviews submitted about other members of the
class. During the final exam period you will be required to carry out
one last self-evaluation and self-reflection about the work you did
throughout the course of the semester.</p>

<p>Your final grade is based on a weighted average of particular
assignment categories. You can estimate your current grade based on
your scores and these weights. You may always visit the instructor
outside of class to discuss your current standing. Assignments and
final grades use a standard grading scale shown below and will not
be curved except in rare cases when deemed necessary by the
instructor.</p>

<p>This courses uses a standard grading scale. Assignments and final
grades will not be curved except in rare cases when its deemed
necessary by the instructor. Percentage grades translate to letter
grades as follows:</p>

<p>You are always welcome to challenge a grade that you feel is unfair or
calculated incorrectly. Mistakes made in your favor will never be
corrected to lower your grade. Mistakes made not in your favor will
be corrected. Basically, after the initial grading your score can
only go up as the result of a challenge*.</p>
