<h2 id="content-and-goals">Content and Goals</h2>

<p>The main goal this semester is to rewrite the front-end in Svelte and
explore SvelteKit. We’ll start completely front scratch and fake the
back-end; the new Spacy pipeline can be integrated later.</p>

<p>You’ve been given access to a private Github repo for this
project. There are several milestones there that serve as our timeline
and list of specific goals.</p>

<p>Through progress in these goals students will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improve their Javascript skills, for both front-end and back-end</li>
  <li>Maintain software projects using <code>git</code> and Github</li>
  <li>Learn about the field of web development</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="expectations-and-policies">Expectations and Policies</h2>

<p>We will have 30 minute weekly meetings. If you’re taking this for 0.5
credits, we’ll meet just once per week; twice per week for 1.0
credits. In these meetings we’ll take a look at your work and set
objectives for the next week. You are expected to make each and every
meeting or to make arrangements ahead of time to make up a misse
dmeeting. At each meeting you will present the current state of your
work and demonstrate that you’ve made progress since the last
meeting. <em>You are encouraged to seek out help and guidance between
meetings if you’re stuck or lacking in direction</em>. You are also
encouraged to work the other members of the research team, even if
they are not an expert on your particular topic.</p>

<p>At the end of each meeting we will set clear goals and objectives for
the next week based on the current state of the work. If you find that
you cannot meet an objective in a reasonable amount of time due to
unforeseen difficulty, that’s fine. Just be ready to explain what you
tried, what worked, what didn’t work, and, to the best of your
ability, the nature of the problem. Account for the time you spent on
the research. The work should be neatly done, well-documented, and
conform to the standards of the open source projects to which we hope
to contribute.</p>

<h2 id="grades-and-grading">Grades and Grading</h2>

<p>Grades are a function of being prompt, prepared, and producing high
quality work. These things are assessed at our weekly meetings through
the work presented at each meeting. You can safely assume that no news
is good news. If your making meetings and showing work at each meeting
but not being told the work is somehow insufficient, then you can
expect an A. When the work is insufficient or poorly done, then you
will be told as much and given feed back on what is lacking and what
needs improvement. At midterm you will be told your current grade. If
at any other time you want a clear, explicit indication of your grade
you need only ask. In general, grading follows the rubric given below.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Grade</th>
      <th>Meeting Attendance</th>
      <th>Weekly Work State</th>
      <th>Quality of Work</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>A</td>
      <td>Never misses</td>
      <td>Always ample work shown</td>
      <td>Well done</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>B</td>
      <td>Missed a few</td>
      <td>Work sometimes insufficient</td>
      <td>Occasionally sloppy. Error free.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>C</td>
      <td>Missed a lot</td>
      <td>Regularly insufficient, occasionally not started.</td>
      <td>Occasionally sloppy. Frequent Errors.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>D</td>
      <td>Missed a lot</td>
      <td>Regularly not started</td>
      <td>Sloppy and error prone</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>Missed most</td>
      <td>Nothing significant to show</td>
      <td>Sloppy and full of errors</td>
    </tr>
