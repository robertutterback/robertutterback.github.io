<h2 id="content-and-goals">Content and Goals</h2>

<p>The senior project is the culminating experience of a student’s major
in computer science and draws upon everything the student has learned
over the course of their studies. The project itself is a means to an
end and not the ultimate goal of the capstone experience. Sufficiently
interesting and complex projects rely on an abundance of existing
research and fundamental principles of computing. The project is, from
this perspective, a concrete instantiation of these ideas and
principles. By carrying out the project and presenting their work to
technical and non-technical audiences students can demonstrate their
understanding and mastery of some core element of the computing
sciences as it appears in the real world context of their project.</p>

<p>Students are ultimately working towards pinpointing general, abstract,
or theoretical concepts that support their project and clearly
articulating how their work is a specific instance of these
concepts. An important part of this process is the identification of
seminal scholarly work that addresses the concept and its
applications. Students too often attempt to reinvent the wheel in the
course of their capstone work. Occasionally they’re unaware that the
wheel already exists. The emphasis on fundamentals is about
identifying the wheels, the documents that lay out the general
principles of those wheels, and focusing on applying those principles
to the specific needs of the project. In doing so the student will
better understand where their work sits in the broad spectrum of
computing and can present it as such.</p>

<p>COMP 402 is focused on the implementation of the plans proposed by the
student in COMP 401 and the identification of the concrete
instantiation of fundamental principles of computer science at play within
the various facets of the project. Each student in the class will give
checkpoint presentations on a semiregular basis in order to receive
feedback from peers and faculty regarding the current state of student
projects and their understanding of the project’s underlying
fundamentals. Towards the end of the semester, students will use their
project as the basis for a Scholar’s Day poster and accompanying
presentation.</p>

<h2 id="attendance-and-expectations">Attendance and Expectations</h2>

<p>Students in this course are expected to be respectful of their peers
and the instructor. As this course is comprised entirely of student
presentations, it is crucial that all students are always present and
always on time. Failure to arrive on time and be a productive member
of the course will have a detrimental effect on the final grade and
leaves a bad impression with faculty that are likely targets for job
and graduate school recommendations.</p>

<h2 id="course-deliverables">Course Deliverables</h2>

<p>The following elements of COMP 401 contribute to the overall capstone grade:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Checkpoint presentations</li>
  <li>A Scholar’s Day poster</li>
  <li>A final presentation</li>
  <li>A publicly available, completed project</li>
  <li>A bibliography of foundational work</li>
  <li>Successful Completion of the Major Field Test in Computer Science</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="checkpoint-presentations">Checkpoint Presentations</h3>

<p>The class will meet for regular project checkpoints. At these
checkpoints each student will give a 5–7 minute presentation that
covers:</p>

<!-- TODO: put this in a separate css file. -->
<style type="text/css">
    ol ol { list-style-type: lower-alpha; }
</style>

<ol>
  <li>The state of the project (1–2 minutes):
    <ol>
      <li>The expected state for this checkpoint based off the current time line</li>
      <li>The actual state with a demonstration of progress</li>
      <li>The expected state for the next checkpoint</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Fundamentals (4–5 minutes)
    <ol>
      <li>Concepts, theories, and abstract principles</li>
      <li>Seminal research and literature</li>
      <li>Project specific instantiations</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>It is important to note that the bulk of each presentation is
dedicated to the presentation of computer science fundamentals as they
appear in the project. The goal is to get accustomed to presenting the
project in the context of a larger issue in as opposed to simply
presenting the project.</p>

<h3 id="scholars-day-posters--final-presentations">Scholar’s Day Posters &amp; Final Presentations</h3>

<p>By the midpoint of the semester students will have identified at least
one fundamental principle that acts as a cornerstone of their
project. One of these principles will become the subject of the
Scholar’s Day poster. It is important that students understand that
<em>the project is not the subject of the poster but the vehicle by which
the actual subject is presented</em>.</p>

<p>The poster is to be done in the standard scientific research
style. The CSB is ripe with examples of this kind of poster. Students
will begin submitting drafts of their posters beginning shortly after
midterm, and the final posters will be presented as a part of the
Scholar’s Day poster session.</p>

<p>The final presentation will be a 7–-10 minute self-evaluation and
debrief about your capstone experience. During this time you should
briefly discuss the final state of your project, what you think went
well this semester, what could have gone better, and what advice you
might have for current and future 401/402 students as they begin
working on their project.</p>

<h3 id="completed-project">Completed Project</h3>

<p>By the end of the semester each student must have a completed
project. It may not entail everything proposed in COMP 401 but it
should be complete by some measurable sense of the word. For example,
it may be a rough prototype of the proposed project or lack some of
the originally proposed features, but still carries out some clearly
identifiable part of the project as proposed. What is important is that
it stands on its own and that the student presents it as such. Too
often students lament the features they didn’t get to and
overemphasize what the project might have been as opposed to what it
finally ended up being.</p>

<p>The final version of the project must be submitted to the instructors
by Scholar’s Day. In addition, students must find a means of making
their work publicly available. Standard paths to this include, but are
not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Making the project open-source and hosting the code on a site like
Github.</li>
  <li>Making a completed application available on an app-store or some
similar means of distribution.</li>
  <li>Uploading a paper to a pre-print archive.</li>
  <li>Submitting a paper for publication.</li>
  <li>Hosing a website on a public server.</li>
</ul>

<p>The exact means by which projects are made publicly accessible must be
approved by the instructors ahead of time. Projects must be publicly
accessible by Scholar’s Day.</p>

<h3 id="project-bibliography">Project Bibliography</h3>

<p>The poster and presentation are in-depth demonstrations of the
students ability to connect their work to a singular larger issues in
computing. This bibliography is a demonstration of the student’s
ability to continue this practice across a broader range of issues as
they relate to their the project. Over the course of COMP 401 and COMP
402 students should have accumulated several key texts related to the
foundational computer science that underlies their project. The
project bibliography should list and cite all of these sources. Some
of these will be cited on the poster and presentation, some will
not. Multifaceted projects will rely on many different ideas and
should thereby have a lengthier bibliography. More constrained
projects might have shorter bibliographies as a reflection of their
narrower focus. Either way, the bibliography should accurately reflect
the breadth and scope of the project.</p>

<h3 id="major-field-test">Major Field Test</h3>

<p>At about the midterm point, students will take the Major Field Test in
Computer Science. This test is meant to provide both the students and
the department with an objective measure of their knowledge of the
fundamental ideas in computer science. The score a student receives
will not have an affect their grade in the course but failire to
complete the test will have a strong negative impact. We hope that
pride and professionalism will drive each student to do their
best. For information about the test, including sample questions, <a href="https://www.ets.org/mft/about/test-content.html#accordion-635e2f095b-item-94920fc127">go
to the ETS
website</a>. In
short, the test consists of 66 multiple choice questions and should
take about two hours.</p>

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>

<p>At the completion of this course, the grade for both COMP 401 and
COMP 402 is determined. Students will typically receive the same grade
in both courses to reflect the work throughout the capstone project
and not in one individual phase of the project. Grades will be
determined based on the following items:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Appropriateness of project difficulty</li>
  <li>COMP 401 checkpoints</li>
  <li>COMP 401 Technical Presentation</li>
  <li>COMP 401 Proposal Poster</li>
  <li>COMP 401 Written Proposal</li>
  <li>COMP 401 Proposal Presentation</li>
  <li>COMP 402 Checkpoint Presentations</li>
  <li>COMP 402 Scholar’s Day Research Poster</li>
  <li>COMP 402 Final Presentation</li>
  <li>A Completed Project</li>
  <li>A Project Bibliography</li>
  <li>Completion of the Major Field Test</li>
</ul>

<p>The following examples provide an idea of what we are looking for in
the above items. <strong>These are rough guidelines only!</strong> Assessment
can vary considerably depending on the project.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>A/A-/B+ range</strong>. Steady progress is made (more or less) from start
to finish. The student takes ownership of the project and approaches
it the right way, with an occasional mishap. The real key is that
<strong>progress can be explained and justified by the student</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>B range</strong>. Attempts are made to explain/justify work, but
explanations often lack a certain level of understanding. Students
with projects in this range are clearly saying what they think they
need to say, sometimes reciting technical information taken verbatim
from various sources.</li>
  <li><strong>B-/C+ range</strong>. Little to no real planning and research in 401. An
idea is proposed and the student talks a lot about what they want to
do, but they never really engage in the problems they’ll encounter
when developing the project. But the student regroups in 402,
working the right way and providing some level of understanding in
their work.</li>
  <li><strong>C range</strong>. Little to no real planning and research in 401 that
carries through to 402. The student is unable to explain and justify
their work beyond showing that something happens. Something works,
but there are lots of bugs or missing features, sometimes including
large components.</li>
  <li><strong>C- range or worse</strong> Little appreciable progress throughout 401
and 402. The student is unable to explain what they did, nor what is
really going on in the code. The code works sometimes but not most
times. The student shows clear signs of stringing together code or
material from other sources with no understanding.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="course-engagement-and-workload-expectations">Course Engagement and Workload Expectations</h3>

<p>The weekly workload for this course will vary by student but on
average should be about 5–7 hours per week. Since class meetings are
only scheduled for 1 hour a week, we expect students to dedicate at
least 4–6 hours a week towards the development of their project
proposal and implementation. This time can include research, coding,
writing, meeting with professors, and so forth. Being a capstone
project, it is likely that your weekly work will occasionally exceed
the expected amount – everything takes longer than you think!</p>

<h2 id="schedule">Schedule</h2>

<p>Checkpoint presentations will occur on roughly a weekly basis. Unless
otherwise specified, the topics listed below are the topics of
checkpoint presentations. These topics correspond to some or all of
sections of the final proposal. <em>This calendar is subject to change
based on the circumstances of the course.</em></p>
