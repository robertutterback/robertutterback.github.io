<h3 id="content">Content</h3>

<p>This course is an exploration of modern programming languages through
the study and implementation of interpreters for fundamental language
features. By exploring, testing, and implementing small languages with
common programming language features, students expand their skill set
with both practical and theoretical knowledge. To understand
programming languages is to understand programming and computation as
a whole. A programming language is how we describe a computational
process and study of the languages themselves helps to shed light on
the inner workings of a computation.</p>

<h4 id="sources">Sources</h4>

<p>The main textbook will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Krishnamurthi, Shriram and Lerner, Benjamin S. and Politz, Joe
Gibbs. <em>Programming and Programming Languages</em>. 2020. Available
<a href="http://papl.cs.brown.edu/2020/">here</a> in HTML format.</li>
</ul>

<p>Be aware that the textbook is a constant work-in-progress. We may
occasionally supplement this with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Krishnamurthi, Shriram. <em>Programming Languages: Application and
Interpretation</em>. 2012. Available
<a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2012/book/">here</a> in HTML format.</li>
</ul>

<p>Throughout the syllabus I refer to the main textbook as “PAPL” and the
supplement textbook as “PLAI”. Other sources will be provided to you
or will be available online.</p>

<h4 id="topics">Topics</h4>

<p>This course will, for the most part, follow the text. Topics to be covered will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Principles of Language Design and Implementation</li>
  <li>Arithmetic Expressions</li>
  <li>Conditionals</li>
  <li>Functions and Procedures</li>
  <li>Records</li>
  <li>State and Mutation</li>
  <li>Garbage Collection</li>
  <li>Types</li>
  <li>Objects</li>
  <li>Parametrized Types</li>
  <li>Type Inference</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="programming-environment">Programming Environment</h4>

<p>We’ll be diving in with the <a href="https://www.pyret.org">Pyret</a> language
that accompanies PAPL. Pyret has an in-browser development environment
and so may be used on any computer with a (modern) web-browser.</p>

<p>For the “Mystery Language” homework assignments we’ll mostly be using
Racket. IMPORTANT: we will require <a href="https://download.racket-lang.org/racket-v7.8.html">Racket version
7.8</a> – other
versions are not supported. Once installed, <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2018/web/mysteries/mystery-setup.xml">follow the setup
instructions
here</a>,
except you should use
<code>https://github.com/shriram/mystery-languages.git</code> as the package
source, NOT the one with <code>samwaxman</code>. A few mystery language
assignments might link to a webpage instead of using Racket.</p>

<p>Submitting: Assignments will be submitted via
<a href="https://www.gradescope.com/">Gradescope</a>.</p>

<h3 id="policies">Policies</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Late assignments</strong>: You have each been allotted a <em>total</em> of <em>5</em>
late days. You may apply these without any penalty to any project you
see fit, with the exception that you may use at most 2 on any
individual project. The whole point here is to give you some
flexibility that allows for things like illnesses, long trips, and the
like. I am unlikely to grant further extensions. Any projects turned
in late will result in a 20% penalty per day.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Academic Dishonesty</strong>: Monmouth College’s official policy on academic dishonesty can be found <a href="http://ou.monmouthcollege.edu/life/residence-life/scots-guide/academic-regulations.aspx">here</a>. <strong>You</strong> are responsible for reading and complying with that policy.<br /><br />
<em>In this course, any violation of the academic honesty policy will have varying consequences depending on the severity of the infraction as judged by the instructor. Minimally, a violation will result in an “F” or 0 points on the assignment in question. Additionally, the student’s course grade may be lowered by one letter grade. In severe cases, the student will be assigned a course grade of “F” and dismissed from the class. All cases of academic dishonesty <strong>must</strong> be reported to the Associate Dean who may decide to recommend further action to the Admissions and Academic Status Committee, including suspension or dismissal. It is assumed that students will educate themselves regarding what is considered to be academic dishonesty, so excuses or claims of ignorance will not mitigate the consequences of any violations</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Collaboration</strong>: We encourage you to make use of the resources available to you – it is fine to seek help from a friend, tutor, instructor, internet, etc. However, <em>copying of answers and any act worth of the label “cheating” is never permissible</em>! In addition to listing your sources and collaborators, you should be producing your own writeup in your own words. By “your own words,” we mean you should be producing the text yourself, without some external aid. Verbatim copying of text is specifically disallowed, but so is taking a source and rearranging some phrases and changing some variable names to create a derivative version! Such behavior is definitely NOT “using your own words.” It does not matter if you helped contribute to this source text with others, since then you are still not the sole author of the text.
The point of collaborating on an assignment is not to produce a jointly authored set of solutions, since that violates the course policies. Instead, it is to help you solve the problems, which sometimes involve a bit of creativity. After you have jointly come up with the ideas you need to solve the problems, though, you should part ways with your group and sit down to do the writing by yourself.
I also advise against sharing the writeup you submit with others, since if someone else uses your text as a source for their own solution (with or without your permission), you will also be implicated in the violation of the academic integrity policy. In any case, if two nearly identical solutions are received, we have no way of tell which is the original, and the policy is to not award credit for either submission.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Electronic Devices</strong>: Do not use your phone or other devices in class except where necessary. Any computer or tablet usage should be related to the course. If a device is not being used for Zoom or Socrative it should be put away and turned on silent. Other usage is rude and distracting to others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>General Expectations</strong>: In short, I expect you to be respectful of others and take
responsibility for your own learning. You are here to learn, so work
hard and be professional.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Just attending class is not sufficient to truly learn the
material. Read the text, use the resources available at Monmouth
College, and go beyond the material.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you miss class, you are responsible for everything covered on
 that day.  College is, in some sense, your job. Take pride in
 creating quality work. Staple your assignments, label problems, and
 present your answers neatly and orderly.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Your job is to convince me that you have learned the material –
show your work! Even if you do not know a particular answer,
guide me through your thought process.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="assignments-and-workload">Assignments and Workload</h4>

<p>The weekly workload for this course will vary by student but on
average should be about 12.5 hours per week. The follow tables
provides a rough estimate of the distribution of this time over
different course components for a 16 week semester.</p>

<h4 id="grading">Grading</h4>

<p>Your participation grade is based mainly on your preparation and
participation in the class meetings and on your homework
<em>presentations</em>. During class, be prepared to use the
<a href="socrative.com">Socrative</a> app for in-class activies. Every day that a
homework assignment is due (including mystery languages), one students
will be randomly selected to present their solution to a portion of
the assignment. You will be graded based on <em>preparation</em> and the
thoroughness of your explanations, NOT on correctness, although you
should of course strive for correctness. Students taking late days
will be required to leave the classroom during these
presentations. You must inform me <em>BEFORE</em> class if you are taking
late days to avoid being randomly selected to present. Otherwise, if
you are randomly selected to present but have not done the assignment,
you will receive a 0.</p>

<p>The majority of the assignments in this course are derived from the
Programming Languages course at Brown University. Homework assignments
may include a variety of activies, but the core will be “mystery
languages.” These require you to investigate the behavior of a mystery
programming language and explain it. This gives you good practice for
real life, where you will often be forced to learn new
languages. Students aiming for A should get nearly all of the “Core”
problems and some of the “Advanced” ones, and should have very good
written summaries. Students aiming for a B should get most of the
“Core” problems.</p>

<p>The other assignments are “interpreters,” which are programming
assignments in which you create or extend programming language tools,
giving you some experience in the design and creation of your own
programming languages. Your grades on these assignments will be based
not only on correctness, but also on <em>quality</em> – both of your
implementation code AND your testing.</p>

<p>Your final grade is based on a weighted average of particular
assignment categories. You can estimate your current grade based on
your scores and these weights. You may always visit the instructor
<em>outside of class</em> to discuss your current standing.</p>

<p>This courses uses a standard grading scale. Assignments and final
grades will not be curved except in rare cases when its deemed
necessary by the instructor. Percentage grades translate to letter
grades as follows:</p>

corrected to lower your grade. Mistakes made not in your favor will
be corrected. Basically, after the initial grading your score can
