<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>Introduction to Programming teaches basic programming skills that are
applicable to a variety of disciplines and also acts as a bridge to
continued studies in computer science. Students will work with the
Python programming language in order to solve basic problems. By the
end of the course students will be able to read and develop computer
programs utilizing the following programming concepts: basic data
types and encoding, variables and scope, array and list data
structures, if statements and conditional execution, loops and
iteration, functions, and object types.</p>

<p>Goals:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Learn what computer science is</li>
  <li>Get excited about programming</li>
  <li>Develop problem-solving skills</li>
  <li>Widen your view about the disciplines tow hich computer science is important</li>
  <li>Learn the basics of the Python programming language</li>
  <li>Express solutions to problems in the form of a program</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="sources">Sources</h4>

<p>Our textbook is <a href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/fopp/index.html">Foundations of Python
Programming</a>. It
is completely online and free, although I <em>highly suggest making a
small donation</em> if you can afford it – providing the interactive
exercises requires money to host the servers that run the code!</p>

<h4 id="softwareaccounts">Software/Accounts</h4>

<p>There are several apps/accounts we will be using for this course.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>An account at <a href="https://runestone.academy">Runestone Academy</a>. Your
account will be automatically created and you will be emailed your
account information at the start of the semester.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During class I will often ask interactive questions using the
<a href="https://socrative.com">Socrative</a> app. Students will need to
create a free student account at
<a href="https://socrative.com">https://socrative.com</a>. While you can
participate in Socrative sessions via a web browser, I recommend
using the free iOS or Android apps <a href="https://socrative.com/apps/">available
here</a>. For very small classes I may
omit the use of Socrative.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While some assignments may be directly through Runestone, most
labs, homework assignments, and projects will be through <a href="https://classroom.github.com/">GitHub
Classroom</a>. Instructions will be
provided during class time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For GitHub Classroom projects, you will need to install <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual
Studio Code</a> and
<a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>. Instructions will be provided
during class/lab time. I recommend installing Python <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">directly from
the website</a> instead of the app
store. If you are on a Mac, you likely already have Python
installed.</p>

<h4 id="assignments-and-workload">Assignments and Workload</h4>

<p>The weekly workload for this course will vary by student and by week
but should be about 12.5 hours per week on average. The following
table provides a rough estimate of the distribution of time over
different course components for a 16 week semester, as well as
detailing the type, amount, and relative value of all assignments.</p>

<p><em>Reading Assignments</em>: Before most classes there will be
an assigned reading in the interactive textbook. Your progress on
these is automatically recorded and visible to me. <!-- These are graded on -->
<!-- a pass/fail basis: you either put in a reasonable amount of effort or -->
<!-- you didn't. --></p>

<p><em>Practice</em>: In addition to the reading assignments, each week you have
review practice questions to complete. These can be found by clicking
👤 &gt; Practice on Runestone. Each week you must complete the
questions on at least 3 days.</p>

<p><em>Exams</em>: All exams are weighted equally and will take approximately
the same amount of time. Exams will generally focus on material
covered since the previous exam but will be in some sense cumulative
due to the nature of programming. Unless stated otherwise, assume that
exams will be pencil and paper and that computers will not be
available during the exam period.</p>

<p><em>Projects</em>: Two larger scale programming projects will be undertaken
during the semester. These projects will be individual efforts and
will require much more effort than the programs written in lab or as
part of homework. Students can expect to have two weeks from the time
of the project assignment to complete the project.  One or more lab
periods will be dedicated to work on the project. It is highly
recommend that all students make ample use of the time given on these
projects.</p>

<p><em>Labs</em>: Most weeks will include an in-class lab assignment. Students
will sometimes be placed into pairs for “paired programming”, a
programming practice where each member of the group takes turns typing
while the other group member helps look for typos, bugs, and otherwise
assists in the design of the code. Each group will submit their work
at the end of the lab period regardless of the overall completeness of
the assignment. The goal is to make good constructive progress on the
assignment. Full credit can and will be given on unfinished work so
long as it can be executed to complete some portion of the given task,
shows evidence of purposeful progress, and the group made full use of
the lab period.</p>

<p><em>Homework</em>: Students will be assigned a set of homework problems,
sometimes from the current chapter of the book. These problems are meant
to guide reading, prepare the student for in-class problems, and
survey the material covered by the exam. Each student will turn in
their own set of solutions.</p>

<h4 id="grading">Grading</h4>

<p>Your final grade is based on a weighted average of particular
assignment categories. You can estimate your current grade based on
your scores and these weights. You may always visit the instructor
outside of class to discuss your current standing. Assignments and
final grades use a standard grading scale shown below and will not
be curved except in rare cases when deemed necessary by the
instructor.</p>

<p>This courses uses a standard grading scale. Assignments and final
grades will not be curved except in rare cases when its deemed
necessary by the instructor. Percentage grades translate to letter
grades as follows:</p>

<p>You are always welcome to challenge a grade that you feel is unfair or
calculated incorrectly. Mistakes made in your favor will never be
corrected to lower your grade. Mistakes made not in your favor will
be corrected. Basically, after the initial grading your score can
only go up as the result of a challenge*.</p>

<p>Lab and homework assignments are graded on a simple 3 point scale,
marked with (in decreasing order) a check-plus, check, or check
minus. Your final grade for these two assignment categories is then
based on the respective averages.</p>

<p>Your participation grade is based on a variety of activities, but
especially answering in-class questions. Questions will cover portions
of the text that were assigned as reading and will range from simple
checks to see if the reading was done to more challenging questions
that follow from a close examination of the reading.  For Socrative
poll questions, the only requirement is to provide an answer to every
question and participate in the resultant discussions. On occasion,
questions will be evaluated for their correctness and performance on 3
these questions will also factor into the course participation
grade. Students who do the reading and start the homework as soon as
possible will have very little to worry about.</p>

<p>While there is no strict attendance policy, the course participation
grade is based in large part on engagement with socrative. Absent
students cannot answer in-class questions. Students should
avoid unexcused absences, as defined in the college-wide absence
policy. Whenever possible, let the instructor know of the absence
before it occurs. When unexcused absences do occur, it is the
student’s responsibility to make up for the lost class time and to
seek the permission of the instructor to hand-in or complete
assignments that are late due to an unexcused absence.</p>

<p>This course is designed around the assumption that students engage in
new ideas <em>before</em> they’re covered in class meetings. This means doing
assigned reading, taking a stab at homework problems, and as a result
coming to class and lab with some understand about a new idea or, just
as likely, with a host of questions about something encountered in the
reading and homework. Not attending class, skipping lab, and putting
off work to the point that an extension is needed are signs that a
student isn’t holding up their end of the bargain and is not prepared
to participate in class.</p>

<h3 id="policies">Policies</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Late assignments</strong>: You have each been allotted a <em>total</em> of <em>5</em> late days. You may apply these to any homework or programming assignment (NOT exams, labs, or reading assignments) you see fit and turn in your solutions with no penalty. Each late days gives you exactly 24 extra hours from the original due date and time. However, you may use <em>at most 2</em> late days on any individual assignment. The whole point here is to give you some flexibility that allows for things like illnesses, long trips, and the like. I am unlikely to grant further extensions. You must notify me if you will use late days, and how many, BEFORE the assignment is due. Late assignments (beyond any applied late days) will be subject to a grade reduction at my discretion. While you should expect a reasonable penalty for late work, know that I will NEVER give you a 0 for late work as long as it is turned in before the final exam. If you
must miss a lab, please contact me <strong>ahead of time</strong> to make
arrangements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Academic dishonesty</strong>: Monmouth College’s official policy on academic dishonesty can be found <a href="https://www.monmouthcollege.edu/offices/student-affairs/academic-regulations/">here</a>. <strong>You</strong> are responsible for reading and complying with that policy.<br /><br />
Note: Use of ChatGPT or similar AI tools is not allowed in this class. While such AI models can be effective tools, they should be utilized only in later courses, and only after a thorough discussion of their use.
<em>In this course, any violation of the academic honesty policy will have varying consequences depending on the severity of the infraction as judged by the instructor. Minimally, a violation will result in an “F” or 0 points on the assignment in question. Additionally, the student’s course grade may be lowered by one letter grade. In severe cases, the student will be assigned a course grade of “F” and dismissed from the class. All cases of academic dishonesty <strong>must</strong> be reported to the Associate Dean who may decide to recommend further action to the Admissions and Academic Status Committee, including suspension or dismissal. It is assumed that students will educate themselves regarding what is considered to be academic dishonesty, so excuses or claims of ignorance will not mitigate the consequences of any violations</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Collaboration</strong>: We encourage you to make use of the resources available to you – it is fine to seek help from a friend, tutor, instructor, internet, etc. However, <em>copying of answers and any act worthy of the label of “cheating” is never permissible</em>! It is understandable that when you work with a partner or a group that the resultant product is often extremely similar. This is acceptable but be prepared to be asked to defend your collaborations to the instructor. <em>You should always be able to reproduce an answer on your own, and if you cannot you likely <strong>do not really know the material</strong></em>.<br /><br />
One way to collaborate effectively is to avoid taking careful notes during a collaboration session. Discuss the material and sketch out possible solutions on a whiteboard. When you have finished, take a break and then write up your solutions without any help from notes or pictures from the study session. This not only helps avoid violations of academic dishonesty, it also improves your retention of the material!<br /><br />
When assignments are meant to be done in groups, you will be directed to turn in one set of solutions per group. Otherwise, each student must turn in an assignment representing their own work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Electronic devices</strong>: Do not use your phone or other devices in class except where necessary. Any computer or tablet usage should be related to the course. If a device is not being used for Zoom or Socrative it should be put away and turned on silent. Other usage is rude and distracting to others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>General expectations</strong>: In short, I expect you to be respectful of others and take
responsibility for your own learning. You are here to learn, so work
hard and be professional.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Just attending class is not sufficient to truly learn the
material. Read the text, use the resources available at Monmouth
College, and go beyond the material.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you miss class, you are responsible for everything covered on
 that day.  College is, in some sense, your job. Take pride in
 creating quality work. Staple your assignments, label problems, and
 present your answers neatly and orderly.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Your job is to convince me that you have learned the material –
show your work! Even if you do not know a particular answer,
guide me through your thought process.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

work is distributed throughout the semester. Assignments and events
