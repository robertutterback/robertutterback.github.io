<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>Introduction to Programming teaches basic programming skills that are
applicable to a variety of disciplines and also acts as a bridge to
continued studies in Computer Science. Students will work with the
Python programming language in order to solve basic problems involving
digital media: images, sound. By the end of the course students will
be able to read and develop computer programs utilizing the following
programming concepts: basic data types and encoding, variables and
scope, array and list data structures, if statements and conditional
execution, loops and iteration, functions, and object types.</p>

<h4 id="sources">Sources</h4>

<p>One textbook is required:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Guadial, Mark J. and Ericson, Barbara. <em>Introduction to Computing
and Programming in Python: A Multimedia Approach</em>. Fourth
Edition. Pearson. Hoboken, NJ. 2016. ISBN-13: 978-0134025544</li>
</ul>

<p>You will <em>NOT</em> need the “access card package” with MyLab
Programming. Other sources will be posted on this webpage as needed.</p>

<h4 id="software">Software</h4>

<p>Introduction to Programming makes heavy use of two pieces of
software. Both are freely available for use on personal devices but
can also be accessed from the college’s computers either directly or
via the web. All programming will be done using Jython Environment for
Students (JES). Downloads for JES can be found
<a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mjguz/mediacomp/mediaComp-teach/index.html#Python">here</a>. Windows
users should download the version that includes the JAR. MAC users
will most likely need the version with OS X workaround. The question
and answer software Socrative will be used on an almost daily basis.
Students will need to create a free student account at
https://socrative.com where it is also possible to participate in
socrative sessions via the web. Socrative also provides free iOS and
Android apps for students to use. You can find them on the respective
app stores or get direct links at https://socrative.com/apps/.</p>

<h3 id="assessment">Assessment</h3>

<h4 id="assignments-and-workload">Assignments and Workload</h4>

<p>The weekly workload for this course will vary by student and by week
but should be about 12.5 hours per week on average. The following table
provides a rough estimate of the distribution of time over different
course components for a 16 week semester, as well as detailing the
type, amount, and relative value of all assignments.</p>

<p><em>Exams</em>: All exams are weighted equally and will take approximately
the same amount of time. Exams will generally focus on material
covered since the previous exam but will be in some sense cumulative
due to the nature of programming. Unless stated otherwise, assume that
exams will be pencil and paper and that computers will not be
available during the exam period.</p>

<p><em>Projects</em>: Two larger scale programming projects will be undertaken
during the semester. These projects will be individual efforts and
will require much more effort than the programs written in lab or as
part of homework. Students can expect to have two weeks from the time
of the project assignment to complete the project.  One or more lab
periods will be dedicated to work on the project. It is highly
recommend that all students make ample use of the time given on these
projects.</p>

<p><em>Homework</em>: Students will be assigned a set of problems from each
chapter of the book covered in the course. These problems are meant to
guide reading, prepare the student for in class problems, and survey
the material covered by the exam. Each student will turn in their own
set of solutions.</p>

<p><em>Labs</em>: Students will be placed into groups of two or three for each
lab. Work will be done using paired programming, a programming
practice where each member of the group takes turns typing while the
other group member helps look for typos, bugs, and otherwise assists
in the design of the code. Each group will submit their work at the
end of the lab period regardless of the overall completeness of the
assignment. The goal is to make good constructive progress on the
assignment. Full credit can and will be given on unfinished work so
long as it can be executed to complete some portion of the given task,
shows evidence of purposeful progress, and the group made full use of
the lab period.</p>

<h4 id="grading">Grading</h4>

<p>Your final grade is based on a weighted average of particular
assignment categories. You can estimate your current grade based on
your scores and these weights. You may always visit the instructor
outside of class to discuss your current standing. Assignments and
final grades use a standard grading scale shown below and will not
be curved except in rare cases when deemed necessary by the
instructor.</p>

<p>This courses uses a standard grading scale. Assignments and final
grades will not be curved except in rare cases when its deemed
necessary by the instructor. Percentage grades translate to letter
grades as follows:</p>

<p>You are always welcome to challenge a grade that you feel is unfair or
calculated incorrectly. Mistakes made in your favor will never be
corrected to lower your grade. Mistakes made not in your favor will
be corrected. Basically, after the initial grading your score can
only go up as the result of a challenge*.</p>

<p>Lab and homework assignments are graded on a simple 3 point scale,
marked with (in decreasing order) a check-plus, check, or check
minus. Your final grade for these two assignment categories is then
based on the respective averages.</p>

<p>Your participation grade is based on a variety of activities, but
especially daily use of Socrative for in-class question and answer
sessions. Questions will cover portions of the text that were assigned
as reading and will range from simple checks to see if the reading was
done to more challenging questions that follow from a close
examination of the reading.  For the most part, the only requirement
is to provide an answer to every question and participate in the
resultant discussions. On occasion, questions will be evaluated for
their correctness and performance on 3 these questions will also
factor into the course participation grade. Students who do the
reading and start the homework as soon as possible will have very
little to worry about.</p>

<p>While there is no strict attendance policy, the course participation
grade is based in large part on engagement with socrative. Absent
students cannot participate in socrative sessions. Students should
avoid unexcused absences, as defined in the college-wide absence
policy. Whenever possible, let the instructor know of the absence
before it occurs. When unexcused absences do occur, it is the
student’s responsibility to make up for the lost class time and to
seek the permission of the instructor to hand-in or complete
assignments that are late due to an unexcused absence.</p>

<p>This course is designed around the assumption that students engage in
new ideas <em>before</em> they’re covered in class meetings. This means doing
assigned reading, taking a stab at homework problems, and as a result
coming to class and lab with some understand about a new idea or, just
as likely, with a host of questions about something encountered in the
reading and homework. Not attending class, skipping lab, and putting
off work to the point that an extension is needed are signs that a
student isn’t holding up their end of the bargain and is not prepared
to participate in class.</p>

<h3 id="policies">Policies</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Late assignments</strong>: You have each been allotted a <em>total</em> of <em>5</em> late days. You may apply these to any problem sets you see fit and turn in your solutions with no penalty. However, you may use at most 2 on any individual assignment. The whole point here is to give you some flexibility that allows for things like illnesses, long trips, and the like. I am unlikely to grant further extensions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Academic dishonesty</strong>: Monmouth College’s official policy on academic dishonesty can be found <a href="http://ou.monmouthcollege.edu/life/residence-life/scots-guide/academic-regulations.aspx">here</a>. <strong>You</strong> are responsible for reading and complying with that policy.<br><br>
<em>In this course, any violation of the academic honesty policy will have varying consequences depending on the severity of the infraction as judged by the instructor. Minimally, a violation will result in an “F” or 0 points on the assignment in question. Additionally, the student’s course grade may be lowered by one letter grade. In severe cases, the student will be assigned a course grade of “F” and dismissed from the class. All cases of academic dishonesty <strong>must</strong> be reported to the Associate Dean who may decide to recommend further action to the Admissions and Academic Status Committee, including suspension or dismissal. It is assumed that students will educate themselves regarding what is considered to be academic dishonesty, so excuses or claims of ignorance will not mitigate the consequences of any violations</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Collaboration</strong>: We encourage you to make use of the resources available to you – it is fine to seek help from a friend, tutor, instructor, internet, etc. However, <em>copying of answers and any act worthy of the label of “cheating” is never permissible</em>! It is understandable that when you work with a partner or a group that the resultant product is often extremely similar. This is acceptable but be prepared to be asked to defend your collaborations to the instructor. <em>You should always be able to reproduce an answer on your own, and if you cannot you likely <strong>do not really know the material</strong></em>.<br><br>
One way to collaborate effectively is to avoid taking careful notes during a collaboration session. Discuss the material and sketch out possible solutions on a whiteboard. When you have finished, take a break and then write up your solutions without any help from notes or pictures from the study session. This not only helps avoid violations of academic dishonesty, it also improves your retention of the material!<br><br>
When assignments are meant to be done in groups, you will be directed to turn in one set of solutions per group. Otherwise, each student must turn in an assignment representing their own work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Electronic devices</strong>: Do not use your phone or other devices in class except where necessary. Any computer or tablet usage should be related to the course. If a device is not being used for Zoom or Socrative it should be put away and turned on silent. Other usage is rude and distracting to others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>General expectations</strong>: In short, I expect you to be respectful of others and take
responsibility for your own learning. You are here to learn, so work
hard and be professional.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Just attending class is not sufficient to truly learn the
material. Read the text, use the resources available at Monmouth
College, and go beyond the material.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you miss class, you are responsible for everything covered on
 that day.  College is, in some sense, your job. Take pride in
 creating quality work. Staple your assignments, label problems, and
 present your answers neatly and orderly.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Your job is to convince me that you have learned the material –
show your work! Even if you do not know a particular answer,
guide me through your thought process.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
