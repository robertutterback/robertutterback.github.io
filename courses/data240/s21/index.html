<h2 id="content">Content</h2>

<h3 id="description">Description</h3>

<p>The purpose of this course is for students to gain practical
experience with data science projects: planning, implementing, and
getting to know the common tools. Students will work in small groups
to develop three different data science applications. A central
component of each application will be the collection, cleaning, and
structuring of data sets. Each application will expose them to
different kinds and sources of data such as relational database and
web-based APIs.  Groups will maintain and develop their projects using
GitHub or GitLab and Git version control software. Students will also
engage in peer-review of the work of their team members and the other
development teams in the course. Upon completing the course students
will know how to formulate basic data science problem statements,
construct appropriate data sets to explore their problems, carry out
the appropriate modeling and analysis for their problem, and present
the findings. Where students’ prior experience covered these things in
pieces, this course will have you work this process from start to end.</p>

<h3 id="sources">Sources</h3>

<p>Books and reference materials will be based on projects assigned but
are likely to be a combination of online resources and instructor
provided handouts. As part of their projects students will learn to
seek out and work with reference material for programming tools and
languages in addition to textbooks.</p>

<h3 id="software">Software</h3>

<p>Every project will use <code>git</code> and GitHub for collaboration and version
control. If you are familiar with the command line you may prefer to
simply use the <code>git</code> command; otherwise you should install a graphical
client. You will need to <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">download
<code>git</code>itself</a>. Although it comes with a
basic graphical client, you may prefer to install a third-party
client; <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a> will suit our
needs, although you may choose whichever you wish.</p>

<h2 id="policies">Policies</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Zoom classes</strong>: If the instructor’s video is turned on, yours should be, too. Any computer, tablet, or phone usage should be directly related to the course, e.g., Zoom or Socrative. Anything else is rude and distracting to others. Inappropriate use of devices, or not turning your video on, will result in a low participation grade.
To fully participate in class, you should plan to attend each Zoom session on a laptop or desktop computer, NOT a tablet or phone. This will allow you to take part in any live-coding exercises with the rest of the class. Please let the instructor know ahead of time if this is not possible for any particular class meeting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Late assignments</strong>: In general, late assignments will <em>not</em> be accepted. Exceptions may be made only for situations beyond your control. If you feel your reason is justified, schedule a meeting with the instructor to plead your case.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Academic dishonesty</strong>: Monmouth College’s official policy on academic dishonesty can be found <a href="http://ou.monmouthcollege.edu/life/residence-life/scots-guide/academic-regulations.aspx">here</a>. <strong>You</strong> are responsible for reading and complying with that policy.<br><br>
<em>In this course, any violation of the academic honesty policy will have varying consequences depending on the severity of the infraction as judged by the instructor. Minimally, a violation will result in an “F” or 0 points on the assignment in question. Additionally, the student’s course grade may be lowered by one letter grade. In severe cases, the student will be assigned a course grade of “F” and dismissed from the class. All cases of academic dishonesty <strong>must</strong> be reported to the Associate Dean who may decide to recommend further action to the Admissions and Academic Status Committee, including suspension or dismissal. It is assumed that students will educate themselves regarding what is considered to be academic dishonesty, so excuses or claims of ignorance will not mitigate the consequences of any violations</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>General expectations</strong>: In short, I expect you to be respectful of others and take
responsibility for your own learning. You are here to learn, so work
hard and be professional.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Just attending class is not sufficient to truly learn the
material. Read the text, use the resources available at Monmouth
College, and go beyond the material.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you miss class, you are responsible for everything covered on
 that day.  College is, in some sense, your job. Take pride in
 creating quality work. Staple your assignments, label problems, and
 present your answers neatly and orderly.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Your job is to convince me that you have learned the material –
show your work! Even if you do not know a particular answer,
guide me through your thought process.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>

<h3 id="assignments-and-workload">Assignments and Workload</h3>

<p>The weekly workload for this course will vary by student and by week
but should be about 12-13 hours per week on average. The following
table provides a rough estimate of the distribution of time over
different course components for a 16 week semester, as well as
detailing the type, amount, and relative value of all assignments.</p>

<p>You can expect to spend most class meetings checking in with your
current development team and the course instructor. Accompanying each
project there will be two presentations: one checkpoint presentation
and one final presentation with an application demo. These
presentations will take place during scheduled class times as
well. You will carry out peer-reviews and self-evaluations after each
presentation.</p>

<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>

<p>Your individual project and presentation grades will be determined
based on the overall group effort as well as your individual
contributions to the application. Individual contributions will be
assessed throughthe project tracking features on GitHub/GitLab,
through feedback provided by peer-reviews done about your work, and
through your own self-evaluations. It will not necessarily be the case
that each member of a group receive the same grade on a project or
presentation. Participation grades will be determined by class
attendance, contributions to discussions on GitHub/GitLab, and through
the quality of your peer-reviews submitted about other members of the
class. During the final exam period you will be required to carry out
one last self-evaluation and self-reflection about the work you did
throughout the course of the semester.</p>

<p>Your final grade is based on a weighted average of particular
assignment categories. You can estimate your current grade based on
your scores and these weights. You may always visit the instructor
outside of class to discuss your current standing. Assignments and
final grades use a standard grading scale shown below and will not
be curved except in rare cases when deemed necessary by the
instructor.</p>

<p>This courses uses a standard grading scale. Assignments and final
