### Content

This course is an exploration of modern programming languages through
the study and implementation of interpreters for fundamental language
features. By exploring, testing, and implementing small languages with
common programming language features, students expand their skill set
with both practical and theoretical knowledge. To understand
programming languages is to understand programming and computation as
a whole. A programming language is how we describe a computational
process and study of the languages themselves helps to shed light on
the inner workings of a computation.

#### Sources

The main textbook will be:

* Krishnamurthi, Shriram and Lerner, Benjamin S. and Politz, Joe
Gibbs. *Programming and Programming Languages*. 2020. Available
[here](http://papl.cs.brown.edu/2020/) in HTML format.

Be aware that the textbook is a constant work-in-progress. We may
occasionally supplement this with:

* Krishnamurthi, Shriram. *Programming Languages: Application and
Interpretation*. 2012. Available
[here](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2012/book/) in HTML format.

Throughout the syllabus I refer to the main textbook as "PAPL" and the
supplement textbook as "PLAI". Other sources will be provided to you
or will be available online.

#### Topics

This course will, for the most part, follow the text. Topics to be covered will include:

* Principles of Language Design and Implementation
* Arithmetic Expressions
* Conditionals
* Functions and Procedures
* Records
* State and Mutation
* Garbage Collection
* Types
* Objects
* Parametrized Types
* Type Inference

#### Programming Environment

Weâ€™ll be diving in with the [Pyret](https://www.pyret.org) language
that accompanies PAPL. Pyret has an in-browser development environment
and so may be used on any computer with a (modern) web-browser.

For the "Mystery Language" homework assignments we'll mostly be using
Racket. IMPORTANT: we will require [Racket version
7.8](https://download.racket-lang.org/racket-v7.8.html) -- other
versions are not supported. Once installed, [follow the setup
instructions
here](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2018/web/mysteries/mystery-setup.xml),
except you should use
`https://github.com/shriram/mystery-languages.git` as the package
source, NOT the one with `samwaxman`. A few mystery language
assignments might link to a webpage instead of using Racket.

Submitting: Assignments will be submitted via
[Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/).

### Policies

* **Late assignments**: You have each been allotted a *total* of *5*
late days. You may apply these without any penalty to any project you
see fit, with the exception that you may use at most 2 on any
individual project. The whole point here is to give you some
flexibility that allows for things like illnesses, long trips, and the
like. I am unlikely to grant further extensions. Any projects turned
in late will result in a 20% penalty per day.

* **Academic Dishonesty**: {{ site.data.policies.cheating_v1 }}

* **Collaboration**: {{ site.data.policies.collab_v2 }}

* **Electronic Devices**: {{ site.data.policies.electronics_v1 }}

* **General Expectations**: {{ site.data.policies.expectations_v1 }}

### Assessment

#### Assignments and Workload

The weekly workload for this course will vary by student but on
average should be about 12.5 hours per week. The follow tables
provides a rough estimate of the distribution of this time over
different course components for a 16 week semester.

| Category                   | Amount |  Final Grade Weight | Total Time | Time/Week (Hours) |
|----------------------------+--------+---------------------+------------+-------------------|
| Meetings                   |      - | 10% (Participation) |          - |               2.5 |
| Interpreters               |   5--8 |                 40% |         56 |               3.5 |
| Homework/Mystery Languages |  8--12 |                 40% |          8 |               4.5 |
| Paper+Presentation         |      1 |                 10% |         24 |                 1 |
| Reading+Unstructured Study |      - |                   - |         16 |                 1 |
|----------------------------+--------+---------------------+------------+-------------------|
|                            |        |                100% |            |              12.5 |

#### Grading

Your participation grade is based mainly on your preparation and
participation in the class meetings and on your homework
*presentations*. During class, be prepared to use the
[Socrative](socrative.com) app for in-class activies. Every day that a
homework assignment is due (including mystery languages), one students
will be randomly selected to present their solution to a portion of
the assignment. You will be graded based on *preparation* and the
thoroughness of your explanations, NOT on correctness, although you
should of course strive for correctness. Students taking late days
will be required to leave the classroom during these
presentations. You must inform me *BEFORE* class if you are taking
late days to avoid being randomly selected to present. Otherwise, if
you are randomly selected to present but have not done the assignment,
you will receive a 0.

The majority of the assignments in this course are derived from the
Programming Languages course at Brown University. Homework assignments
may include a variety of activies, but the core will be "mystery
languages." These require you to investigate the behavior of a mystery
programming language and explain it. This gives you good practice for
real life, where you will often be forced to learn new
languages. Students aiming for A should get nearly all of the "Core"
problems and some of the "Advanced" ones, and should have very good
written summaries. Students aiming for a B should get most of the
"Core" problems.

The other assignments are "interpreters," which are programming
assignments in which you create or extend programming language tools,
giving you some experience in the design and creation of your own
programming languages. Your grades on these assignments will be based
not only on correctness, but also on *quality* -- both of your
implementation code AND your testing.

Your final grade is based on a weighted average of particular
assignment categories. You can estimate your current grade based on
your scores and these weights. You may always visit the instructor
*outside of class* to discuss your current standing.

{{ site.data.policies.gradescale_std_v1 }}

You are always welcome to challenge a grade that you feel is unfair or
calculated incorrectly. Mistakes made in your favor will never be
corrected to lower your grade. Mistakes made not in your favor will be
corrected. *Basically, after the initial grading your score can only
go up as the result of a challenge.*

### Schedule
The following calendar should give you a feel for how work is
distributed throughout the semester. Assignments and events are listed
in the week they are due or when they occur. *This calendar is subject
to change based on the circumstances of the course*.

Note: Readings should be completed *BEFORE* the start of class on the
day on which they appear.
