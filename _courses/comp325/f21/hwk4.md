## "Scope" Mystery Language[^1]

#### Due Wednesday, September 29 by the start of class (10 AM). Submit via Gradescope.

Complete the "scope" mystery language (`#lang
mystery-languages/scope`). You should ignore the documentation[^2] -- the
scope language you have has the same syntax as the 'fun-calls'
language. There are two language variants.

If you find yourself spending more than 2 hours on this, please ask for a hint.

Reminder: You can find a brief description of this family of languages
at [the documentation](https://github.com/shriram/mystery-languages).

[^1]: This assignment, like most in this course, comes from Brown University's Programming Languages course.

[^2]: Since the start of the class, the mystery language repository has been updated with some new/changed langauges. Do NOT update to the latest version!
