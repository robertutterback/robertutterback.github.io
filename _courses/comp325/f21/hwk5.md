## "Anonymous Functions" Mystery Language[^1]

#### Due Friday, October 22 by the start of class (10 AM). Submit via Gradescope.

Complete the ["anonymous functions" mystery
language](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2016/assignments/mysteries/anonymous-functions.xml). **Note
that we are NOT using Dr. Racket for this!** language. 

There are two language variants. The syntax is quite different than
our previous mystery languages, so you will need to spend some times
on the syntax.

If you find yourself spending more than 3 hours on this, please ask for a hint.

[^1]: This assignment, like most in this course, comes from Brown University's Programming Languages course.
