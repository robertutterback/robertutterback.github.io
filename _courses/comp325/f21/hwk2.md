## "Conditionals" Mystery Language[^1]

#### Due Monday, September 07 by the start of class (10 AM). Submit via Gradescope.

Complete the "Conditionals" mystery language (`#lang mystery-languages/conditionals`).

Reminder: First, you should get acquainted with the mystery languages by
[reading the
documentation](https://github.com/shriram/mystery-languages). Then go
ahead and explore the "arithmetic" family of languages.

[^1]: This assignment, like most in this course, comes from Brown University's Programming Languages course.
