title: "COMP 240: Computer Applications, Spring 2025"
catalog-desc: "In Computer Applications students will work in small groups to develop three different computer applications. Each application will expose them to a different computing platform along with the tools and computing concepts used in developing programs for that platform. The platform and purpose of each application will vary from year to year and instructor to instructor, but common choices of platforms include: the command line interface, the web, mobile devices, and high-performance computing. Students will maintain and develop their projects using GitHub or GitLab and Git version control software. Students will also engage in peer-review of the work of their team members and the other development teams in the course. Upon completing the course students will know how to apply basic software engineering practices in a small group setting, how to maintain software through the Git version control system, and have experience with tools and best-practices for developing modern software applications for three different computing platforms."

### Description

In this course, students will work in small groups to develop three
different computer applications. Each application will expose them to
a different computing platform along with the tools and computing
concepts used in developing programs for that platform. The platform
and purpose of each applications will vary from year to year and
instructor to instructor, but common choices of platforms include: the
command line interface, the web, mobile devices, and high-performance
computing. Students will maintain and develop their projects using
GitHub and Git version control software. Emphasis will be placed on
building effective software development teams as well as building the
software itself. Upon completing the course students will know how to
apply basic software engineering practices in a small group setting,
how to maintain software through the git version control system, and
will have experience with tools and best-practices for developing
modern software applications for three different computing platforms.

### Course Goals

1. Collaboratively Develop
   - Work effectively in small teams to design, plan, and execute software projects.
   - Gain experience with team-based workflows, including communication, task delegation, and conflict resolution.
2. Apply Software Engineering Practices
   - Use Git and GitHub for version control, issue tracking, and collaboration.
   - Follow modern software development workflows, including Agile practices such as SCRUM.
   - Develop skills in debugging, testing, and documenting code.
3. Adapt to New Tools and Platforms
   - Explore a variety of computing platforms (e.g., command line, web, mobile, high-performance computing) and their associated tools and frameworks.
   - Conduct independent research to learn new languages, libraries, or development environments required for each project.
4. Build Larger, Multi-Phase Projects
   - Plan and execute projects with a scope greater than typical course assignments, focusing on implementation and iteration rather than full design from scratch.
   - Reflect on and refine workflows through retrospectives.
5. Improve Technical Communication
   - Present progress and results through structured checkpoint and final presentations.
   - Deliver clear, concise, and professional explanations of technical concepts, user stories, team processes, and outcomes.
6. Prepare for Capstone and Beyond
   - Develop skills in independent research and team collaboration that will prepare students for their capstone project and professional software development roles.
   - Gain exposure to diverse software development practices that can be adapted to various team and industry settings.

### Sources

Books and reference materials will be based on projects assigned but
are likely to be a combination of online resources and instructor
provided handouts. As part of their projects students will learn to
seek out and work with reference material for programming tools and
languages in addition to textbooks.

### Software

Every project will use `git` and GitHub for collaboration and version
control. You will need to [download `git`
itself](https://git-scm.com/downloads). This can be used via the
command line or simply within any of the integrated development
environments we will be using. You may also choose to install a
third-party graphical client such as [GitHub
Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

We will use [GitHub](https://github.com/) for repository hosting and
project management. You will need to create a GitHub account if you
don't already have one.

Beyond those, each project will use different software. We will
discuss installation and use of all software (including `git` and
GitHub) during class time.

## Assessment

### Assignments and Workload

The weekly workload for this course will vary by student and by week
but should be about 10 hours per week on average. The following
table provides a rough estimate of the distribution of time over
different course components for a 16 week semester, as well as
detailing the type, amount, and relative value of all assignments.

| Category                 | Amount | Final Grade Weight               | Time/Week (Hours) |
|--------------------------+--------+----------------------------------+-------------------|
| Class Meetings           |     42 | 10% (**In-class participation**) | 2.5               |
| Project 0                |      1 | 10%                              | -                 |
| **Projects 1-3**         |      3 | 25% each, 75% total              | 7                 |
| &emsp;- GitHub Activity  |      - | &emsp; 5% each, 15% total        | -                 |
| &emsp;- Presentations    |  12-13 | &emsp; 5% each, 15% total        | -                 |
| &emsp;- Resulting Code   |        | &emsp; 15% each, 45% total       | -                 |
| Project/Peer Evaluations |      3 | 5%                               | 0.5               |
|--------------------------+--------+----------------------------------+-------------------|
| Total                    |        | 100%                             | 10                |

You can expect to spend most class meetings checking in with your
current development team and the course instructor. Accompanying each
project there will typically be four presentations: three (sometimes
four) checkpoint presentations and one final presentation. These
presentations will take place during scheduled class times.

#### In-Class Participation

Your in-class participation score will be judged based on (1) your
frequency of unexcused absences, and (2) your active engagement and
collaboration with your team: asking or answering questions,
contributing ideas, doing research, etc.

#### Evaluations

After each final presentation, you will submit three kinds of evaluations:

- Project evaluation: an evaluation of each member's contributions and
  of how well the team worked together overall, and a reflection on
  your own contributions and how you can better contribute
- Peer evaluation: an evaluation of other teams' final presentation

#### Projects

Detailed information about the projects can be found [here](proj),
with additional instructions provided on a per-project basis.

### Grading

Your individual project and presentation grades will be determined
based on the overall group effort as well as your individual
contributions to the application. Individual contributions will be
assessed throughthe project tracking features on GitHub, through
feedback provided by peer-reviews done about your work, and through
your own self-evaluations. It will not necessarily be the case that
each member of a group receive the same grade on a project or
presentation. More information about project grading can be found
[here](proj).

Your final grade is based on a weighted average of particular
assignment categories. You can estimate your current grade based on
your scores and these weights. You may always visit the instructor
outside of class to discuss your current standing. Assignments and
final grades use a standard grading scale shown below and will not
be curved except in rare cases when deemed necessary by the
instructor.

{{ site.data.policies.gradescale_std_v1 }}

You are always welcome to challenge a grade that you feel is unfair or
calculated incorrectly. Mistakes made in your favor will never be
corrected to lower your grade. Mistakes made not in your favor will be
corrected. *Basically, after the initial grading your score can only
go up as the result of a challenge.*

## Schedule
The following **tentative** calendar should give you a feel for how
work is distributed throughout the semester. Assignments and events
