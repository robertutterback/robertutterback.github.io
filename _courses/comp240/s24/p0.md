title: "COMP240 (S24) -- Intro to Git & Github"
semester: s24
---

This isn't a typical project -- it's a crash course in the software
and services that will drive all your collaborative efforts in this
class.

Disclosure: this project is derived from a similar one by Logan
Mayfield.

### During class on 1/16

After we go over the syllabus and logistics of the course, we'll all
do the [Github
Quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart). You'll
need to read a bit, make a Github account, create and interact with a
repository, and install Git on your laptop.

You'll need to email me your Github username and a link to the repo
you created.

### Before class on 1/18

Read chapter 1 of [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).

### During class on 1/18

By now you should have a Github account, a working installation of
some form of Git, and have been added to our Github Classroom. Now
let's practice Github flow:

1. Review the "Github Flow" section in Github's [Quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
2. Get our *Intro Git* assignment from Github classroom using the emailed link
3. Make a local clone of your assignment repo
4. Make a new branch
5. Add a new Markdown file with your lastname as the filename, e.g., `utterback.md`
6. In your file, answer the survey questions below. Play around with [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) a little!
7. Commit your changes to the branch.
8. Push your branch.
9. Create a PR for your pushed branch.
10. Merge your PR.
11. Pull the updated main branch from the remote.
12. Inform your instructor that your assignment is done.
