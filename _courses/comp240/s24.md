## Content

### Description

In this course, students will work in small groups to develop three
different computer applications. Each application will expose them to
a different computing platform along with the tools and computing
concepts used in developing programs for that platform. The platform
and purpose of each applications will vary from year to year and
instructor to instructor, but common choices of platforms include: the
command line interface, the web, mobile devices, and high-performance
computing. Students will maintain and develop their projects using
GitHub and Git version control software. Emphasis will be placed on
building effective software development teams as well as building the
software itself. Upon completing the course students will know how to
apply basic software engineering practices in a small group setting,
how to maintain software through the git version control system, and
will have experience with tools and best-practices for developing
modern software applications for three different computing platforms.

### Sources

Books and reference materials will be based on projects assigned but
are likely to be a combination of online resources and instructor
provided handouts. As part of their projects students will learn to
seek out and work with reference material for programming tools and
languages in addition to textbooks.

### Software

Every project will use `git` and GitHub for collaboration and version
control. If you are familiar with the command line you may prefer to
simply use the `git` command; otherwise you should install a graphical
client. You will need to [download
`git`itself](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Although it comes with a
basic graphical client, you may prefer to install a third-party
client; [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) will suit our
needs, although you may choose whichever you wish.

## Assessment

### Assignments and Workload

The weekly workload for this course will vary by student and by week
but should be about 12-13 hours per week on average. The following
table provides a rough estimate of the distribution of time over
different course components for a 16 week semester, as well as
detailing the type, amount, and relative value of all assignments.

| Category              | Amount |      Final Grade Weight | Time/Week (Hours) |
|-----------------------+--------+-------------------------+-------------------|
| Class Meetings        |     42 | 15% (**Participation**) |               2.5 |
| **Peer-Reviews**      |      6 |                       - |               0.5 |
| **Presentations**     |     12 |                     35% |                 2 |
| **Projects**          |      3 |                     45% |               7-8 |
| Final Self-Evaluation |      1 |                      5% |                 - |
|-----------------------+--------+-------------------------+-------------------|
| Total                 |        |                    100% |             12-13 |

You can expect to spend most class meetings checking in with your
current development team and the course instructor. Accompanying each
project there will be four presentations: three checkpoint
presentations and one final presentation with an application
demo. These presentations will take place during scheduled class times
as well. You will carry out peer-reviews and self-evaluations after
each presentation.

### Grading

Your individual project and presentation grades will be determined
based on the overall group effort as well as your individual
contributions to the application. Individual contributions will be
assessed throughthe project tracking features on GitHub/GitLab,
through feedback provided by peer-reviews done about your work, and
through your own self-evaluations. It will not necessarily be the case
that each member of a group receive the same grade on a project or
presentation. Participation grades will be determined by class
attendance, contributions to discussions on GitHub/GitLab, and through
the quality of your peer-reviews submitted about other members of the
class. During the final exam period you will be required to carry out
one last self-evaluation and self-reflection about the work you did
throughout the course of the semester.

Your final grade is based on a weighted average of particular
assignment categories. You can estimate your current grade based on
your scores and these weights. You may always visit the instructor
outside of class to discuss your current standing. Assignments and
final grades use a standard grading scale shown below and will not
be curved except in rare cases when deemed necessary by the
instructor.

{{ site.data.policies.gradescale_std_v1 }}

You are always welcome to challenge a grade that you feel is unfair or
calculated incorrectly. Mistakes made in your favor will never be
corrected to lower your grade. Mistakes made not in your favor will be
corrected. *Basically, after the initial grading your score can only
go up as the result of a challenge.*

## Schedule
The following **tentative** calendar should give you a feel for how
work is distributed throughout the semester. Assignments and events
are listed in the week they are due or when they occur. *This calendar
is subject to change based on the circumstances of the course*.
