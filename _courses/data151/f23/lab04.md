## Lab 04: Data Wrangling

(This lab is heavily based on material created by Jenny Smetzer,
William Hopper, Beth Brown, and Albert Y. Kim, with minor
modifications.)

The main instructions for this lab can be [found here](https://moderndive.github.io/moderndive_labs/static/PS/PS03_data_wrangling.html),
with the following modifications:

- You'll use RStudio on your own machines, not RStudio Server.
- It's optional to create a new folder for your files. If you do, you
  can name it something like "data151" instead of "introstatsR".
- Any time those instructions mention something happening on the
  server, just remember your code is actually executing on your own
  laptop, not a server.
- When you have successfully "knit" your final document, open the HTML
  file in a browser, print it out, and hand it in.

## Homework 2

In section 3.9 of our textbook, do "Learning check" 3.20 (LC3.20). In
addition, choose an appropriate plot to display the result
graphically.

Write an R Markdown file containing (1) all R code used, (2)
explanations for each part of your code, (3) a table showing the
result, and (4) your plot.

To produce a nice display of the table, use the `kable` function from
the `knitr` package. See [this
page](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-7.html) for the basics of
how to use it.

After knitting, print out the document and hand it in on **Wednesday,
October 4, 9:00 AM**.
