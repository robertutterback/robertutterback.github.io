## Lab 08: Multiple Regression

(This lab is heavily based on material created by Jenny Smetzer,
William Hopper, Beth Brown, and Albert Y. Kim, with minor
modifications.)

The main instructions for this lab can be [found
here](https://moderndive.github.io/moderndive_labs/static/PS/PS06_multiple_reg.html). You
may work with another person for this lab. You can fill out your
answers directly in the [instructions Rmd file](../lab08.Rmd).

Note: The assignment is titled "Problem Set 06" on that website, but please title yours "Lab 08".
