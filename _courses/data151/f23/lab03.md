## Lab 03: Data Visualization with `ggplot2`

(This lab is heavily based on material created by Jenny Smetzer,
William Hopper, Beth Brown, and Albert Y. Kim, with minor
modifications.)

The main instructions for this lab can be [found here](https://moderndive.github.io/moderndive_labs/static/PS/PS02_data_viz.html),
with the following modifications:

- You'll use RStudio on your own machines, not RStudio Server.
- It's optional to create a new folder for your files. If you do, you
  can name it something like `data151` instead of `introstatsR`.
- Any time those instructions mention something happening on the
  server, just remember your code is actually executing on your own
  laptop, not a server.
