## Content

### Description

An introduction to the concepts and techniques of database
systems. Includes history and motivation of database systems, data
modeling, rational database, SQL, transaction processing, distributed
databases.

### Learning Objectives

1. Be able to query existing databases using SQL to gain effective insights.
2. Design and structure your own databases, understanding trade-offs
   between redundancy, reliability, and speed.
3. Understand the basics about how database store and access data,
   even in the presence of many simultaneous users or disk failures.
4. Understand and describe the motivation and basics behind new
   database technologies, including NoSQL and Big Data ecosystems.

<!-- See [Student Learning Outcomes](#student-learning-outcomes). -->

### Sources

The required textbook is:

* Silberschatz, Abraham and Korth, Henry F. and Sudarshan,
  S. [*Database System Concepts* (7th
  Edition)](https://www.db-book.com/db7/). McGraw-Hill
  Education. 2019. ISBN-13: 978-0-078-02215-9
  
The [textbook webpage](https://www.db-book.com/db7/) is a great source
of additional information, including solutions to practice exercises,
scripts to load the sample data, and tips on using specific databases.
  
We may occasionally have readings from other sources, which will
either be emailed to students or posted to the schedule below.

Additionally, there are many resources on the web for learning about
databases, and especially about SQL. One good is [this MySQL
Tutorial](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/).

### Software

In class I will often make use of the
[Socrative](https://socrative.com) app, so you'll need to install this
on your phones. We will also occasionally write SQL queries together
in [repl.it](https://repl.it/), so you will need an account there.

In terms of Database Management Systems we will usually stick to
[SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html) and
[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/).

* There is nothing to download for SQLite -- you can execute queries
  in your browser using the [Online SQLite
  interpreter](https://www.db-book.com/db7/university-lab-dir/sqljs.html),
  which comes pre-loaded with the textbook's university data.
* To interact with a MySQL DBMS you will use [MySQL
  Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/). **Note: you
  do NOT need to create an Oracle account when it asks you
  to. Instead, just click the link that says "No thanks, just start my
  download".** You can use this to access the DBMS hosted on the
  department server (details given in class), or you may install
  [MySQL Community Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) on
  your own machine. Again note that you do not need to create an
  Oracle account. If you use this option you will need to load any
  sample data yourself using the scripts provided on the [textbook
  webpage](https://www.db-book.com/db7/).

## Policies

* **Zoom classes**: {{ site.data.policies.zoom_v1 }}

* **Late assignments**: You are allotted a *total* of *5* days. You
  may apply these to any homework assignment (NOT projects) as you see
  fit and turn in your solutions with no penalty. However, you may use
  at most 2 on any individual assignment. The point is to give you
  some flexibility for illnesses, long trips, etc. I am unlikely to
  grant further extensions. If you are selected to give a presentation
  based on a homework exercise and wish to use late days, you must
  schedule your presentation for the next class period, although a
  *different* exercise may be chosen by the instructor!

* **Academic dishonesty**: {{ site.data.policies.cheating_v1 }}

* **Collaboration**: {{ site.data.policies.collab_v2 }}

* **General expectations**: {{ site.data.policies.expectations_v1 }}

## Assessment

### Assignments and Workload

The weekly workload for this course will vary by student and by week
but should be about 13 hours per week on average. The following table
provides a rough estimate of the distribution of time over different
course components for a 16 week semester, as well as detailing the
type, amount, and relative value of all assignments.

| Category                   | Amount |      Final Grade Weight | Time/Week (Hours) |
|----------------------------+--------+-------------------------+-------------------|
| Lectures/Class             |     42 | 10% (**Participation**) |               2.5 |
| **Homework**               |  8--10 |                     20% |                 3 |
| **Presentations**          |   1--3 |                     10% |                 - |
| Exam Study                 |      - |                       - |                 2 |
| **Exams**                  |      3 |                     30% |                 - |
| **Projects**               |      2 |                     30% |               3.5 |
| Reading/Unstructured Study |      - |                       - |                 2 |
|----------------------------+--------+-------------------------+-------------------|
| Total                      |        |                    100% |                13 |

Homework assignments may include written exercises and/or programming
assignments. When homework is due, the instructor may select 1 or more
exercises to be presented. Students will be randomly selected (with
replacement) to present their solution. 

Each exam will focus primarily, but not necessarily exclusively, on
the material covered since the previous exam.

### Grading

In-class presentations will be graded on a simple 3-point scale:

- 0: Nothing of substance; little effort
- 1: Needs significant work
- 2: Mostly or fully correct

If you are unable to attend a class, you must notify the instructor
*prior* to the class. If you do not, and you are randomly selected to
present, you will receive a 0. It is possible that you are never
randomly selected, in which case you will receive full credit for this
portion of the grade.

Your participation grade is based on a variety of activities. During
class I will often make use of the [Socrative](https://socrative.com)
app, so youâ€™ll need to install this on your phones. Participating in
Socrative questions and with in-class group activities is required for
a decent participation grade; an A includes asking questions either in
class or in office hours.

Your final grade is based on a weighted average of particular
assignment categories. You can estimate your current grade based on
your scores and these weights. You may always visit the instructor
outside of class to discuss your current standing. Assignments and
final grades use a standard grading scale shown below and will not
be curved except in rare cases when deemed necessary by the
instructor.

{{ site.data.policies.gradescale_std_v1 }}

You are always welcome to challenge a grade that you feel is unfair or
calculated incorrectly. Mistakes made in your favor will never be
corrected to lower your grade. Mistakes made not in your favor will be
corrected. *Basically, after the initial grading your score can only
go up as the result of a challenge.*

## Schedule
The following **tentative** calendar should give you a feel for how
work is distributed throughout the semester. Assignments and events
are listed in the week they are due or when they occur. *This calendar
is subject to change based on the circumstances of the course*.

**Note**: All readings should be done **before** the class period in
which they are listed below.

Each day's slides/notes can be found in [this shared
folder](https://monmouthcollege-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/rutterback_monmouthcollege_edu/El9m6H7DIk9PmTw_63XCwhABvx_cembEy2hSjaVvBX1fCg?e=6RM3Cl). You
will need to be logged in to your Monmouth College account to see the
folder. If I have not uploaded the week's slides by Friday afternoon
you are free to email me a reminder.
