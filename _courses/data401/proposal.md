title: "DATA 401 Project Proposal"
catalog-desc: (todo)
semester: s21
---

DATA 401 culminates with the formal proposal of your senior capstone
project. The proposal is given in two forms:

1. Written Project Proposal
2. Proposal Presentation

The presentation is effectively a summary of the written proposal given in a public forum.

## Written Proposal

The written proposal should contain the sections listed below. Each
section has an estimated page length next to it. Page length estimates
assume *single spaced, 11 pt. font*. Please note that these are
estimates and the most important thing is that each section is
detailed enough for project at hand.

| Section                           | Length (pages) |
|-----------------------------------+----------------|
| Abstract                          |           1--2 |
| Background/Introduction           |           3--5 |
| Project Description               |          5--10 |
| Foundations                       |         10--15 |
| Implementation Plan and Time Line |           2--5 |
| Conclusion                        |           1--2 |
| Bibliography & Works Cited        |           2--4 |
|-----------------------------------+----------------|
|                                   |         24--43 |

### Abstract

The abstract should be roughly one to two pages and should give a high
level summary of the document. One should be able to read the abstract
and determine what the project is and why it's interesting and
important. The goal is to get the reader interested in the work and
believing that the proposer has a firm, actionable plan for carrying
it out next semester.

### Background & Introduction

This section introduces the project along with the problems and ideas that led to its conception. The emphasis here is on the end product. To whom is this project interesting and important and why? The goal is to establish the wider socio-technical context in which that end product exists, namely:

* The problem or problems (social, technical, or otherwise) addressed
  by the project.
* How, specifically, the project addresses or solves the problem.
* What work is related or comparable to the project and what niche is
  filled by the project. Meaning, if similar work is out there, then
  how is this project different? If this project is totally unique,
  then to what is it's uniqueness attributed?

### Project Description and Analysis

This section lays down the technical details for the project. Where
the background section spells out the what and the why of the project,
this section begins the process of explaining, at least in the
abstract, the how of the project. What exactly needs to go in here
will vary from project to project. Likely candidates include:

* A clear, and explicit discussion of the features of the project
* Concrete use cases for the project.
* A high to mid-level system design and architecture
* An outline of a paper
* Experimental plans

When all is said and done, the reader should have a very concrete idea
of what the project entails after reading this section and feel
confident that this project, if completed, would address the issues
discussed in the previous section.

### Foundations

This section continues establishing the *how* of your project by
connecting the high level description of the previous section to
foundational research and ideas in data science. Students should:

* Identify seminal research related to their work
* Discuss the specific instantiation of that research in the confines of their project
* Assess the difficulty of a project component with respect to the status of existing research

Where the project description connects the real-world problems and
issues to concrete components of the project, this section establishes
the feasibility of those components by exploring their status as
solved or open problems.

### Implementation Plan and Time Line

It is in this section students lay down the path they intended to take
to get from start to finish. This should include:

* A *detailed* time line from DATA 402 including bi-weekly checkpoints.
* A discussion of tools (software, languages, libraries, etc.) to be used
* Testing/Editing/Revising Plans
* Priorities and plans for scaling back if needed

The previous sections should convince the reader that the proposer has
explored the project to a depth sufficient for having a realistic
sense of what needs to get done and its feasibility. This section then
explains how that work can get done over the course of a semester.


### Conclusion

The final section of the proposal should be both a summary of the
proposal and a place to reflect on the work ahead. The reader needs to
be assured that this project is worth doing and that the proposer is
capable of doing it.

### Bibliography & Works Citied

All proposals should contain some amount of inline citations as
they'll need to refer to previous research and existing tool such as
libraries and languages. All of these cited documents and works should
appear in the bibliography. In addition to these sources, students
should clearly list key resources, documentation, and foundation
research they expect to utilize when carrying out their work in DATA
402.

## Presentation

Students will give a *20 to 30 minute* presentation of their proposed work. It is essentially the oral form of the written proposal. The presentation outline should mirror the paper's outline. The following are rough estimates of the number of minutes one might expect to spend per section.

| Section                 | Length (min) |
|-------------------------|--------------|
| Background/Introduction | 2--5         |
| Project Description     | 5--7         |
| Foundations             | 7--10        |
| Plan for DATA 402       | 3--5         |
| Conclusion              | 2--3         |


There will be time for questions after the presentation, and students
should be prepared to explain and re-explain the plans and details of
the project.
