<aside class="notes">
<p>
We'll first start with linear models for binary classification, so if
there are only two classes. That makes the models much easier to
understand.
</p>

<p>
<b>NOTE</b>: I didn't mention this last time: sometimes we'll use 0 and 1,
 sometimes -1 and 1. It makes the math work out easier in particular
 cases. Here we will use 1 and -1, even though the book uses 1 and 0.

Similar to the regression case, basically all linear models for
classification have the same way to make predictions. As with
regression, they compute an inner product of a weight vector w with
the feature vector x, and add some bias b. The result of that is a
real number, as in regression. For classification, however, we only
look at the sign of the result, so whether it is negative or
positive. If it's positive, we predict one class, usually called +1,
if it's negative, we predict the other class, usually called -1. If
the result is 0, by convention the positive class is predicted, but
because it's a floating point number that doesn't really happen in
practice. You'll see that sometimes in my notation I will not have
a b. That's because you can always add a constant feature to x to
achieve the same effect (thought you would then need to leave that
feature out of the regularization). So when I write wTx without a b
assume that there is a constant feature added that is not part of any
regularization (although I will try to use theta*b in that case&#x2026;).
</p>

<p>
Geometrially, what the formula means is that the decision boundary of
a linear classifier will be a hyperplane in the feature space, where w
is the normal vector of that plane. In the 2d example here, it's just
a line separating red and blue. Everything on the right hand side
would be classified as blue by this classifier, and everything on the
left-hand side as red.
</p>

<p>
Questions? So again, the learning here consists of finding parameters
w and b based on the training set, and that is where the different
algorithms differ. There are quite a lot of algorithms out there, and
there are also quite a lot in scikit-learn, but we'll only discuss the
most common ones.
</p>

<p>
The most straight-forward way to approach finding w and b is to use
the framework of empirical risk minimization that we talked about last
time, so finding parameters that minimize some loss of the training
set. Where classification differs quite a bit from regression is on
how we want to measure misclassifications.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
So we need to define a loss function for given w and b that tell us
how well they fit the training set. Obvious Idea: Minimize number of
misclassifications aka 0-1 loss but this loss is non-convex, not
continuous and minimizing it is NP-hard. So we need to relax it, which
basically means we want to find a convex upper bound for this
loss. This is not done on the actual prediction, but on the inner
product wTx, which is also called the decision function. So this graph
here has the inner product on the x axis, and shows what the loss
would be for class 1. The 0-1 loss is zero if the decision function is
positive, and one if it's negative. Because a positive decision
function means a positive predition, means correct classification in
the case of y=1. A negative prediction means a wrong classification,
which is penalized by the 0-1 loss with a loss of 1, i.e. one mistake.
</p>

<p>
The other losses we'll talk about are mostly the hinge loss and the
log loss. You can see they are both upper bounds on the 0-1 loss but
they are convex and continuous. Both of these losses care not only
that you make a correct prediction, but also "how correct" your
prediction is, i.e. how positive or negative your decision function
is. We'll talk a bit more about the motivation of these two losses,
starting with the logistic loss.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Logistic regression is probably the most commonly used linear
classifier, maybe the most commonly used classifier overall. The idea
is to model the log-odds (logit), which is log p(y=1|x) - log p(y=0|x) as a
linear function, as shown here. Rearranging the formula, you get a
model of p(y=1|x) as 1 over 1 + &#x2026; This function is called the
logistic sigmoid, and is drawn to the right here. Basically it
squashed the linear function wTx between 0 and 1, so that it can model
a probability.
</p>

<p>
Given this equation for p(y|x), what we want to do is maximize the
probability of the training set under this model. This approach is
known as maximum likelihood. Basically you want to find w and b such
that they assign maximum probability to the labels observed in the
training data. You can rearrange that a bit and end up with this
equation here, which contains the log-loss as seen on the last
slide. Notice that because we're using y=1 or y=-1, we directly use yi
here in a different way than the book.
</p>

<p>
The prediction is the class with the higher probability. In the binary
case, that's the same as asking whether the probability of class 1 is
bigger or smaller than .5. And as you can see from the plot of the
logistic sigmoid, the probability of the class +1 is greater than .5
exactly if the decision function wTx is greater than 0. So predicting
the class with maximum probability is the same as predicting which
side of the hyperplane given by w we are on.
</p>

<p>
Ok so this is logistic regression. We minimize this loss and get a w
which defines a hyper plane. But if you think back to last time, this
is only part of what we want. This formulation tries to fit the
training data, but it doesn't care about finding a simple solution.

<h3 id="org11e4274">Penalized Logistic Regression</h3>
<p>
\[ \minw C \summ \logloss + \ltwo{\vec{w}}^2 \]
\[ \minw C \summ \logloss + \lone{\vec{w}} \]
</p>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Both versions 'strongly' convex, l2 version smooth (diff.)</li>
<li>All points contribute to w (dense solution to dual)</li>

</ul>

<p>
So we can do the same we did for regression: we can add regularization
terms using the L1 and L2 norm. The effects are the same as for
regression: both push the coefficients towards zero, but the l1 norm
encourages coefficients to be exactly zero, for the same reasons we
discussed last time.
</p>

<p>
You could also use a mixed penalty to get something like the
elasticnet, and indeed that's now available in sklearn.
</p>

<p>
But here is a different notation: C vs. alpha. Q: How do they relate?
</p>

</aside>

<p>
\[ \minw C \summ \logloss + \ltwo{\vec{w}}^2 \]
\[ \minw C \summ \logloss + \lone{\vec{w}} \]
</p>

<ul>
<li>\(C\) is inverse to \(\alpha\) (or \(\frac{\alpha}{n}\))</li>
<li>Both versions strongly convex, l2 version smooth (differentiable).</li>
<li>All points contribute to w</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Here I used a slightly different notation as last time, though. I'm
not using alpha to multiply the regularizer, instead I'm using C to
multiply the loss. That's mostly because that's how it's done in
scikit-learn and it has only historic reasons. The idea is exactly the
same, only now C is 1 over alpha. So large C means heavy weight to the
loss, means little regularization, while small C means less weight on
the loss, means strong regularization.
</p>

<p>
Depending on the model, there might be a factor of n<sub>samples</sub> in there
somewhere. Usually we try to make the objective as independent of the
number of samples as possible in scikit-learn, but that might lead to
surprises if you're not aware of it.
</p>

<p>
Some side-notes on the optimization problem: here, as in regression,
having more regularization makes the optimization problem easier. You
might have seen this in your homework already, if you decrease C,
meaning you add more regularization, your model fits more quickly.
</p>

<p>
One particular property of the logistic loss, compared to the hinge
loss we'll discuss next is that each data point contributes to the
loss, so each data point has an effect on the solution. That's also
true for all the regression models we saw last time.

<ul>
<li>Small C limits influence of individual points.</li>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
So I spared you with coefficient plots, because they looks the same as
for regression. All the things I said about model complexity and
dependency on the number of features and samples is as true for
classification as it is for regression.
</p>

<p>
There is another interesting way to thing about regularization that I
found helpful, though. I'm not going to walk through the math for
this, but you can reformulate the optimization problem and find that
what the C parameter does is actually limit the influence of
individual data points. With very large C, we said we have no
regularization. It also means individual data points can have
basically unlimited influence, as you can see here. There are two
outliers here, which basically completely tilt the decision
boundary. But if we decrease C, and therefore increase the
regularization, what happens is that the influence of these outlier
points becomes limited, and the other points get more influence.

Here are two examples on the same dataset where Andreas trained linear
support vector machine with c=0.1, and c=1. With c=0.1, you have a
wider margin. There are points inside the margin and all the points
inside the margin are support vectors which contribute to the
solution. Points that are outside of the margin and on the correct
side doesn't contribute to the solution. These points are sort of
classified correctly, not when they’re ignored. The normal vector is w
and basically, the size of the margin is the inverse of the length
of w. C=0.1 means I have less emphasis on the data fitting and more
emphasis on the shrinking w. This will lead to a smaller w (thus
larger margin). If I have larger C that means less regularization,
which will lead to a larger W, larger W means a smaller margin. So
there are fewer points here, they are inside the margin and therefore,
fewer support vectors. More regularization usually means a larger
margin but more points inside the margin. Also, more support vectors
mean there are more data points that actually influence the solution.

Moving from logistic regression to linear SVMs is just a matter of
changing the loss from the log loss to the hinge loss. The hinge-loss
is defined as &#x2026; And we can penalize using either l1 or l2 norm, or
again, in principle also elastic net. This formulation with the hinge
loss doesn't really make sense without the penalty, because of the
formulation of the hinge loss. What this loss says is basically "if
you predict the right class with a margin of 1, there is no
loss". Otherwise the loss is linear in the decision function. So you
need to be on the right side of the hyperplane by a given amount, and
then there is no more loss. That's the reason you need the penalty,
for the 1 to make sense. Otherwise you could just scale up w to make
it far enough on the right side. But the regularization penalizes
growing w.
</p>

<p>
The hinge loss has a kink, same as the l1 norm, and so it's not a
smooth optimization problem any more, but that's not really a big
deal. What's interesting is that all the points that are classified
correctly with a margin of at least 1 have a loss of zero, and so they
don't influence the solution any more. All the points that are not
classified correctly by this margin are the ones that do influence the
solution and they are called the support vectors.

So which one of them should you use? If you need probability
estimates, you should use logistic regression. If you don't, you can
pick either, and it doesn't really matter. Logistic regression can be
a bit faster to optimize in theory. If you're in a setting where
there's many more feature than samples, it might make sense to use
linear SVMs and solve the dual, but you can actually solve either of
the problems in the dual, and we'll talk about what that means in
practice in a little bit.

The binary logistic regression case can be generalized to multinomial
logistic regression, in which we model the probability that i is one
of the classes using this formula, which is also known as softmax. The
probability is proportional to e to the minus wtx which is the same as
in the binary case. But now we need to normalize it so that the sum
over all classes is one. So we just divide it by this sum.

svc uses ovo and hinge loss, LinearSVC uses ovr and squared hinged
loss, linearSVC will be faster

lars: feature selection much more quickly (for regression)
