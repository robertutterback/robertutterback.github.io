## Content

### Description

In this course we examine the technology and fundamental principles
governing communications between computers, i.e., computer
networking. Careful attention will be paid to the modern Internet and
the technologies that support it. Students will use a combination of
hands-on network analysis, programming assignments, and written
problems to explore the top four layers of the five protocol layers of
computer networking: the application layer, transport layer, network
layer, and the link layer. This study encompasses the first six
chapters of the text. Time permitting, we'll examine basic issues in
network security, the eighth chapter of the text.

### Sources

The required textbook is:

* Kurose, James F. and Ross, Keith W. *Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach* (8th
  Edition). Pearon. 2021. ISBN-13: 9780135928608.
  
We may occasionally have readings from other sources, which will
either be emailed to students or posted to the schedule below.

### Software

In class I will often make use of the
[Socrative](https://socrative.com) app, so you'll need to install this
on your phones.

Many assignments will make use of the
[Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) packet sniffer. All students
will need to install this program. Other networking software will be
discussed as needed.

## Policies

* **Late assignments**: You are allotted a *total* of *5* days. You
  may apply these to any homework assignment (NOT projects) as you see
  fit and turn in your solutions with no penalty. However, you may use
  at most 2 on any individual assignment. The point is to give you
  some flexibility for illnesses, long trips, etc. I am unlikely to
  grant further extensions. You must email the instructor *before* the
  due date if you wish to use late days.

* **Academic dishonesty**: {{ site.data.policies.cheating_v1 }}

* **Collaboration**: {{ site.data.policies.collab_v2 }}

* **Electronic Devices**: {{ site.data.policies.electronics_v1 }}

* **General expectations**: {{ site.data.policies.expectations_v1 }}

## Assessment

### Assignments and Workload

The weekly workload for this course will vary by student and by week
but should be about 12 hours per week on average. The following table
provides a rough estimate of the distribution of time over different
course components for a 16 week semester, as well as detailing the
type, amount, and relative value of all assignments.

| Category                   | Amount |     Final Grade Weight | Time/Week (Hours) |
|----------------------------+--------+------------------------+-------------------|
| Lectures/Class             |     42 | 5% (**Participation**) |               2.5 |
| **Problem Sets**           |   5--6 |                    25% |               2.5 |
| **Wireshark Labs**         |   5--6 |                    25% |                 3 |
| Exam Study                 |      - |                      - |                 1 |
| **Exams**                  |   4--6 |                    30% |                 - |
| **Reading Quizzes**        |   Many |                    15% |                 - |
| Reading/Unstructured Study |      - |                      - |                 3 |
|----------------------------+--------+------------------------+-------------------|
| Total                      |        |                   100% |                12 |

Problem sets may include written exercises and/or programming
assignments. When homework is due, the instructor may select 1 or more
exercises to be presented. Students will be randomly selected (with
replacement) to present their solution. Such presentations are graded
as a part of your problem set grade.

Each exam will focus primarily, but not necessarily exclusively, on
the material covered since the previous exam.

### Grading

In-class presentations will be graded on a simple 3-point scale:

- 0: Nothing of substance; little effort
- 1: Needs significant work
- 2: Mostly or fully correct

If you are unable to attend a class, you must notify the instructor
*prior* to the class. If you do not, and you are randomly selected to
present, you will receive a 0. It is possible that you are never
randomly selected, in which case you will receive full credit for this
portion of the grade.

Your participation grade is based on a variety of activities. During
class I will often make use of the [Socrative](https://socrative.com)
app, so you'll need to install this on your phones. Participating in
Socrative questions and with in-class group activities is required for
a decent participation grade; an A includes asking questions either in
class or in office hours.

Your final grade is based on a weighted average of particular
assignment categories. You can estimate your current grade based on
your scores and these weights. You may always visit the instructor
outside of class to discuss your current standing. Assignments and
final grades use a standard grading scale shown below and will not
be curved except in rare cases when deemed necessary by the
instructor.

{{ site.data.policies.gradescale_std_v1 }}

You are always welcome to challenge a grade that you feel is unfair or
calculated incorrectly. Mistakes made in your favor will never be
corrected to lower your grade. Mistakes made not in your favor will be
corrected. *Basically, after the initial grading your score can only
go up as the result of a challenge.*

## Schedule
The following **tentative** calendar should give you a feel for how
work is distributed throughout the semester. Assignments and events
are listed in the week they are due or when they occur. *This calendar
is subject to change based on the circumstances of the course*.

**Note**: All readings should be done **before** the class period in
which they are listed below.
