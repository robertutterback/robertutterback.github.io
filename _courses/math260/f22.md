## Content

### Description
An introduction to proof-based mathematics through the study of key
areas of discrete mathematics. This course serves as an introduction
to higher-level mathematics and advanced coursework in math. Students
will hone their mathematical reasoning skills, learning to express and
work with precise mathematical definitions. A strong emphasis is
placed on developing the skills necessary to communicate mathematical
results.

Topics covered in this course include the the core definitions and
theorems from set theory, mathematical logic, and combinatorics.  In
this context students will explore ideas such as mathematical
induction, functions, and relations and the proof techniques of direct
proof, contrapositive proof, proof by contradiction, and disproof.

## Assessment

### Assignments and Workload
The weekly workload for this course will vary by student and by week
but should be about 12 hours per week on average. The following table
provides a rough estimate of the distribution of time over different
course components for a 16 week semester, as well as detailing the
type, amount, and relative value of all assignments.

| Category      | Amount | Final Grade Weight  | Time/Week (Hours) |
|---------------+--------+---------------------+-------------------|
| Lectures      |     41 | 10% (Participation) |               2.5 |
| Problem Sets  |   5--8 | 35%                 |                 6 |
| Reading/Study |      - | -                   |               3.5 |
| Exams         |   5--8 | 55%                 |                 - |
|---------------+--------+---------------------+-------------------|
|               |        |                     |                12 |

Much of the material builds on previous material; hence, exams are
naturally cumulative. Each exam is weighted equally.

Your lowest problem set score will be dropped, i.e., your final
problem set grade is the average of all except the minimum.

### Grading

Your participation grade is based on a variety of activities. During
class I will often make use of the [Socrative](https://socrative.com)
app, so you'll need to install this on your phones. Participating in
Socrative questions and with in-class group activities is required for
a decent participation grade; an A includes asking questions either in
class or in office hours.

An additional portion of your participation grade is based on your
problem set *presentations*. Every day that a problem set is due, one
or more students will be randomly selected to present their solution
to a portion of the assignment. You will be graded based on
*preparation* and the thoroughness of your explanations, NOT on
correctness, although you should of course strive for
correctness. Students taking late days will be required to leave the
classroom during these presentations. You must inform me *BEFORE*
class if you are taking late days to avoid being randomly selected to
present. Otherwise, if you are randomly selected to present but have
not done the assignment, you will receive a 0.

Your final grade is based on a weighted average of particular
assignment categories. You can estimate your current grade based on
your scores and these weights. You may always visit the instructor
outside of class to discuss your current standing. Assignments and
final grades use a standard grading scale shown below and will not
be curved except in rare cases when deemed necessary by the
instructor.

{{ site.data.policies.gradescale_std_v1 }}

You are always welcome to challenge a grade that you feel is unfair or
calculated incorrectly. Mistakes made in your favor will never be
corrected to lower your grade. Mistakes made not in your favor will be
corrected. *Basically, after the initial grading your score can only
go up as the result of a challenge.*
