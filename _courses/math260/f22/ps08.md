## 2.5: Truth Tables

8,10

## 2.6: Logical Equivalence

2,8

One additional question: The difference between <=> and = is
subtle. Read [this Stack Exchange
post](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2432462/whats-the-difference-between-biconditional-iff-and-logical-equivalence)
about the difference (and possibly some pages that are linked from
it), and write a short paragraph summarizing your take on the
difference.
