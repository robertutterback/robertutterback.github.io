## Project 1: Building a Key-Value Store

For this C warmup project you'll be implementing a key-value
store. This project is taken directly from our textbook authors, so
all the details [can be found
here](https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects/tree/master/initial-kv).

One clarification: In the instructions, they note that the value of a
`put` can be "an arbitrary string (without commas in it)." We will
assume the value also cannot contain spaces.

### Submitting

Submit using `handin` on the department server:

```bash
$ handin comp345 proj1 kv.c
```

**Due Friday, 1/20 by the start of class**
