## Project 3: Parallel Web Server

For this project you'll get some real parallel/concurrent programming
experience by creating a concurrent web server. You'll be given a
working, sequential web server and are tasked with making it
multi-threaded.

As in past projects, the details are on our textbook authors' Github,
in the [ostep-projects
repo](https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects/tree/master/concurrency-webserver).

### Submitting

Submit using `handin` on the department server:

```bash
$ handin comp345 proj3 wish.c
```

**Due Wednesday, 04/05 by midnight.**
