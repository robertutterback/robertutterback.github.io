### Content

#### Description

Introduction to Programming teaches basic programming skills that are
applicable to a variety of disciplines and also acts as a bridge to
continued studies in computer science. Students will work with the
Python programming language in order to solve basic problems. By the
end of the course students will be able to read and develop computer
programs utilizing the following programming concepts: basic data
types and encoding, variables and scope, array and list data
structures, if statements and conditional execution, loops and
iteration, functions, and object types.

Goals:
1. Learn what computer science is
2. Get excited about programming
3. Develop problem-solving skills
4. Widen your view about the disciplines tow hich computer science is important
5. Learn the basics of the Python programming language
6. Express solutions to problems in the form of a program

#### Sources

Our textbook is [Foundations of Python
Programming](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/fopp/index.html). It
is completely online and free, although I *highly suggest making a
small donation* if you can afford it -- providing the interactive
exercises requires money to host the servers that run the code!

#### Software/Accounts

There are several apps/accounts we will be using for this course.

1. An account at [Runestone Academy](https://runestone.academy). Your
   account will be automatically created and you will be emailed your
   account information at the start of the semester.

2. During class I will often ask interactive questions using the
   [Socrative](https://socrative.com) app. Students will need to
   create a free student account at
   [https://socrative.com](https://socrative.com). While you can
   participate in Socrative sessions via a web browser, I recommend
   using the free iOS or Android apps [available
   here](https://socrative.com/apps/). For very small classes I may
   omit the use of Socrative.

3. While some assignments may be directly through Runestone, most
   labs, homework assignments, and projects will be through [GitHub
   Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/). Instructions will be
   provided during class time.
   
4. For GitHub Classroom projects, you will need to install [Visual
   Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and
   [Python](https://www.python.org/). Instructions will be provided
   during class/lab time. I recommend installing Python [directly from
   the website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) instead of the app
   store. If you are on a Mac, you likely already have Python
   installed.

### Assessment

#### Assignments and Workload

The weekly workload for this course will vary by student and by week
but should be about 12.5 hours per week on average. The following
table provides a rough estimate of the distribution of time over
different course components for a 16 week semester, as well as
detailing the type, amount, and relative value of all assignments.

| Category                     | Amount |  Final Grade Weight | Time/Week (Hours) |
|------------------------------+--------+---------------------+-------------------|
| Lectures                     |    ~41 | 10% (Participation) |               2.5 |
| Labs                         |  8--10 |                 10% |                 3 |
| Homework                     |   6--8 |                 10% |                 1 |
| Exam Study                   |      - |                   - |                 1 |
| Exams                        |   4--5 |                 30% |                 - |
| Projects                     |      2 |                 30% |                 3 |
| Reading Assignments/Practice |      - |                 10% |                 2 |
|------------------------------+--------+---------------------+-------------------|
| *Total*                      |        |                     |              12.5 |

*Reading Assignments*: Before most classes there will be
an assigned reading in the interactive textbook. Your progress on
these is automatically recorded and visible to me. <!-- These are graded on -->
<!-- a pass/fail basis: you either put in a reasonable amount of effort or -->
<!-- you didn't. -->

*Practice*: In addition to the reading assignments, each week you have
review practice questions to complete. These can be found by clicking
&#128100; > Practice on Runestone. Each week you must complete the
questions on at least 3 days.

*Exams*: All exams are weighted equally and will take approximately
the same amount of time. Exams will generally focus on material
covered since the previous exam but will be in some sense cumulative
due to the nature of programming. Unless stated otherwise, assume that
exams will be pencil and paper and that computers will not be
available during the exam period.

*Projects*: Two larger scale programming projects will be undertaken
during the semester. These projects will be individual efforts and
will require much more effort than the programs written in lab or as
part of homework. Students can expect to have two weeks from the time
of the project assignment to complete the project.  One or more lab
periods will be dedicated to work on the project. It is highly
recommend that all students make ample use of the time given on these
projects.

*Labs*: Most weeks will include an in-class lab assignment. Students
will sometimes be placed into pairs for "paired programming", a
programming practice where each member of the group takes turns typing
while the other group member helps look for typos, bugs, and otherwise
assists in the design of the code. Each group will submit their work
at the end of the lab period regardless of the overall completeness of
the assignment. The goal is to make good constructive progress on the
assignment. Full credit can and will be given on unfinished work so
long as it can be executed to complete some portion of the given task,
shows evidence of purposeful progress, and the group made full use of
the lab period.

*Homework*: Students will be assigned a set of homework problems,
sometimes from the current chapter of the book. These problems are meant
to guide reading, prepare the student for in-class problems, and
survey the material covered by the exam. Each student will turn in
their own set of solutions.

#### Grading

Your final grade is based on a weighted average of particular
assignment categories. You can estimate your current grade based on
your scores and these weights. You may always visit the instructor
outside of class to discuss your current standing. Assignments and
final grades use a standard grading scale shown below and will not
be curved except in rare cases when deemed necessary by the
instructor.

{{ site.data.policies.gradescale_std_v1 }}

You are always welcome to challenge a grade that you feel is unfair or
calculated incorrectly. Mistakes made in your favor will never be
corrected to lower your grade. Mistakes made not in your favor will be
corrected. *Basically, after the initial grading your score can only
go up as the result of a challenge.*

Lab and homework assignments are graded on a simple 3 point scale,
marked with (in decreasing order) a check-plus, check, or check
minus. Your final grade for these two assignment categories is then
based on the respective averages.

Your participation grade is based on a variety of activities, but
especially answering in-class questions. Questions will cover portions
of the text that were assigned as reading and will range from simple
checks to see if the reading was done to more challenging questions
that follow from a close examination of the reading.  For Socrative
poll questions, the only requirement is to provide an answer to every
question and participate in the resultant discussions. On occasion,
questions will be evaluated for their correctness and performance on 3
these questions will also factor into the course participation
grade. Students who do the reading and start the homework as soon as
possible will have very little to worry about.

While there is no strict attendance policy, the course participation
grade is based in large part on engagement with socrative. Absent
students cannot answer in-class questions. Students should
avoid unexcused absences, as defined in the college-wide absence
policy. Whenever possible, let the instructor know of the absence
before it occurs. When unexcused absences do occur, it is the
student's responsibility to make up for the lost class time and to
seek the permission of the instructor to hand-in or complete
assignments that are late due to an unexcused absence.

This course is designed around the assumption that students engage in
new ideas *before* they're covered in class meetings. This means doing
assigned reading, taking a stab at homework problems, and as a result
coming to class and lab with some understand about a new idea or, just
as likely, with a host of questions about something encountered in the
reading and homework. Not attending class, skipping lab, and putting
off work to the point that an extension is needed are signs that a
student isn't holding up their end of the bargain and is not prepared
to participate in class.
