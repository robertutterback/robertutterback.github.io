## Content

### Description

**Inquiry & Identity** is a transition into the Monmouth College
learning community which values the spirit of inquiry in pursuit of
academic excellence. I&I sections are taught by faculty from
departments across campus, and I&I instructors also serve as academic
advisers for first-year students.

I&I courses invite first-year students to delve into questions of
human values and purposes. These are the central values of the liberal
arts. Through them and through our work with common texts,
convocations and other activities, we consider the meaning and
significance of complex issues.

In addition to exploring a liberal arts educational philosophy and
supporting students’ transition to college, discussions and activities
in this course draw on concepts in the course’s title: Inquiry, which
is an active process of engaging fully in the process of learning, and
Identity, which is an exploration of the diverse, intersectional and
multifaceted qualities of self-hood and belonging.

### Learning Goals

1. Students will explore the themes of Inquiry & Identity as a means
   to engage with questions of human values, experiences, purposes,
   and communities and as a means to explore connections among
   disciplines and among diverse perspectives. Students will learn
   that a liberal arts education can be transformative, preparing them
   to pursue fulfilling personal and professional lives.
2. Students will understand key components for engaging in the
   intellectual and personal challenges of college and for becoming
   life-long learners. These components include developing a strong
   and consistent work ethic, adopting an attitude of inquiry,
   functioning from a growth-mindset, and approaching all aspects of
   the transition to college with tenacity and resilience.
3. Students will consider their identity and discover that their sense
   of self and their engagement with the community affects their
   quality of life and the lives of those around them. Students will
   consider the diverse, intersectional, and multifaceted qualities of
   identity, which may include, social class, race and ethnicity,
   gender, sexuality, ability, and geographic location.
4. Students will understand that inquiry is an active process that
   engages learners’ previous knowledge, requires close attention to
   reading, and involves analysis and questioning. Students will learn
   how reading provides a means to connect to conversations that can
   develop our understanding of ourselves, our world, and is a source
   not only of learning but also of enjoyment.
   
### Core Curriculum Learning Objectives

1. Students will communicate ideas clearly and effectively.
2. Students will identify, analyze, and interpret information in relevant contexts.
3. Students will evaluate and synthesize information to construct meanings.
4. Students will explain diverse identities, histories, and perspectives of self and others
5. Students will examine societal forces, structures, and systems within or outside of the U.S.
6. Students will critically reflect on learning experiences.

This year FYII will be assessed on learning objective #6.

## Assessment

### Assignments and Workload
The weekly workload for this course will vary by student and by week
but should be about **12.5 hours per week on average**. The following
table provides a rough estimate of the distribution of time over
different course components for a 16 week semester, as well as
detailing the type, amount, and relative value of all assignments.

| Category                       |  Final Grade Weight | Time/Week (Hours) |
|--------------------------------+---------------------+-------------------|
| Class/Convocation              | 20% (Participation) |               3.5 |
| Exams/Exam Prep                |                 15% |                 1 |
| Reading Assignments/Class Prep |                 45% |                 6 |
| Experience-based Writing       |                 20% |                 2 |
|--------------------------------+---------------------+-------------------|
|                                |                     |              12.5 |

Your final grade is based on a weighted average of particular
assignment categories. You can estimate your current grade based on
your scores and these weights. You may always visit the instructor
outside of class to discuss your current standing. Assignments and
final grades use a standard grading scale shown below and will not be
curved except in rare cases when deemed necessary by the instructor.

No extra credit will be given on an individual basis.

### Reading-based Assessments

This is reading-focused course, so every day there will be reading
assignment and a quiz, homework question(s), or writing assignment
based on the reading. Examples include close-reading, annotation, or
weekly mini-essay assignments.

Your lowest 4 reading-based assessment scores will be dropped.

### Experience-based Writing

As opposed to the reading-Based writing that connects directly to the
readings of the course, experience-based writings respond to other
required components of the course such as convocations and outside
events.

#### Responses to Convocations

You will be assigned a written response of around 1 page for 3-4
convocations. More information will be provided prior to each
convocation.

#### Responses to Outside Events

Over the course of the semester you must attend and participate in
three "outside events" during the semester. "Outside" means "not a
regular part of class," not "outdoors" or "off campus." You'll be
expected to write a short reflection about the event and relate it to
the themes of the class. More information on this assignment will be
provided at a later date.

### Final Exam

At the end of the semester there will be an open-notes comprehensive
exam, worth 15% of your grade.

### Participation

This is a discussion-based class, so it is essential that you come
prepared to actively participate. This can take many forms, including:
regular class attendance, carefully reading and annotating the
assigned texts, sharing your thoughts, opinions, and insights during
discussions, considering and raising opposing viewpoints, engaging in
respectful dialogue with others, listening attentively to others'
perspectives, and following the discussion policies listed in the
policies section.

At various points I may make use of the
[Socrative](https://socrative.com) app, so you’ll need to install this
on your phone. Participating in Socrative questions and with in-class
group activities is required for a decent participation grade.

### Grade Scale

{{ site.data.policies.gradescale_std_v1 }}

## Policies

TLDR: I expect you to (1) be respectful of others, and (2) take
responsibility for your own learning. You are here to learn, so work
hard and be professional.

* **Attendance**: You are allotted a total of *4* unexcused absences
(from class or Tuesday convocations/mentoring sessions) without direct
penalty to your grade. On your fifth absense, you will fail the
course. College-sanctioned events may be excused from this policy, but
a reduction of the final grade may be an outcome of too many excused
absences.. If you feel you may miss more class than this, contact
Student Affairs who may then act on your behalf.

* **Late assignments**: {{ site.data.policies.late_none_v1 }}

* **Discussions**: The goal of a discussion is to understand and learn
  from the perspectives of others in order to better understand our
  own beliefs and the world around us. Your participation is vital
  both for your own learning experience and for those of your
  classmates. Thus participation will be grade not only on quantity,
  but on *quality*. You should respect individual differences and
  viewpoints -- you are allowed and encouraged to disagree with other
  students, the professor, or the texts, but disagreement should
  always be expressed in a respectful manner inside and outside of the
  classroom (whether virtual or not).

* **Academic dishonesty**: {{ site.data.policies.cheating_v1 }}

* **Citations**: When writing, make it clear what text you are
  discussing. This information can be included in the first sentence
  of your written response, at the top of the page, or as part of your
  response to a specific question. **ALWAYS INCLUDE A PAGE NUMBER**
  with any information that is not yours. Signal when *any
  information* comes from a specific page of a text rather than being
  your original idea or personal observation/interpretation, whether
  that comes in the form of a direct quote, paraphrase, or summary.

* **Electronic devices**: {{ site.data.policies.electronics_v1 }}

## Schedule
The following **tentative** calendar should give you a feel for how
work is distributed throughout the semester. Assignments and events
are listed in the week they are due or when they occur. *This calendar
is subject to change based on the circumstances of the course*.

**Note**: All readings should be done **before** the class period in
which they are listed below.
