## The Command Line

#### Due by August 31 by the start of class.

0. To answer the below questions, log on to the department
   server. (There is nothing to answer for this question; I will check
   the logs on the server to see if you did it.)
1. The `man` command is used to get help by reading the manual for a
   given command, e.g., `man ls`. Once you've opened a man page, how
   do you exit?
2. Run `uname -r` on the department server (`cs.monm.edu`). Show the
   output. Briefly explain what it means (hint: try running `man
   uname`).
3. What is the location of the `bash` command? Hint: first learn about
   the `which` command.
4. The `ls` command is located in `/bin/ls`. And yet, you can run `ls`
   wherever you are. Briefly describe how the shell locates the `ls`
   command when you type it.
5. Let's say I am in the `/home/rutterback/comp235` directory. How can
   I move "up" to `/home/rutterback` without having to type out
   `/home/rutterback`?
6. Consider the command `cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep processor`. Describe
   what each part of it is doing. Then, run the command and show the
   output. What do you think this is telling us about the server?
