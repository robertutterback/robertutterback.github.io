## Content

### Description
An introduction to low-level programming and computer hardware
organization form a software perspective. The emphasis is on
understanding how application programmers can use knowledge of the
entire system to write better programs. Students will learn about data
representation, machine language, the memory hierarchy, and virtual
memory through programming assignments in C and assembly
language. Further topics may include processor architecture, code
optimization, and concurrency.

Basically, the aim of this course is to (1) convince students that no
magic is required to make computers work, and (2) help students
understand how hardware decisions can affect their programs.

### Sources

The course textbook will be:

* Bryant, Randal E. and O'Hallaron, David R.  _Computer Systems: A
Programmer's Perspective_. 3rd Edition. Pearson. 2015. ISBN-13:
978-0134092669.

We will also be using parts of [Dive into
Systems](https://diveintosystems.org/), a free, online textbook.

Since we will be using a lot of C, some of you may wish to have a more
in-depth reference manual. The following is pretty good:

* Harbison III, Samuel P. and Steele Jr., Guy L. _C: A Reference Manual_. Pearson. 2002. ISBN-13: 978-0130895929.

However, you may be able to get by with online documentation only:

* [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/c/)
* [CppReference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language)
* [GNU C Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-c-manual/gnu-c-manual.html)

Other sources will be posted on this webpage as needed.

### Topics

The goal of this course is to produce programmers who understand how
the correctness and performance of their applications are impacted by
the compilation system, operating system, and hardware. After
dedicating some time to learning C, the course aims to cover the
majority of chapters 1-9 of the text.

| - Basics of C           | - Memory Hierarchy                          |
| - Tour of Systems       | - Linking                                   |
| - Data Representations  | - Exceptional Control Flow (as time allows) |
| - Machine Language      | - Virtual Memory                            |
| - Code Optimization     | - Processor Architecture (as time allows)   |
| - x86 Assembly Language | - Dynamic Memory                            |

### Programming Environment

This course involves programming in both C and assembly language. All
necessary tools will be available on the department server. All
software for this course is available free of charge and can be found
on the web if students wish to install it on their personal
machines. The instructor cannot guarantee support for installing and
using other development environments.

## Assessment

### Assignments and Workload
The weekly workload for this course will vary by student and by week
but should be about 12 hours per week on average. The following table
provides a rough estimate of the distribution of time over different
course components for a 16 week semester, as well as detailing the
type, amount, and relative value of all assignments.

| Category                   | Amount | Final Grade Weight  | Total Time | Time/Week (Hours) |
|----------------------------+--------+---------------------+------------+-------------------|
| Lectures                   |     41 | 10% (Participation) |          - |               2.5 |
| Programming Assignments    |    5-7 | 30%                 |         48 |                 4 |
| Homework                   |    6-8 | 25%                 |         32 |               2.5 |
| Exam Study                 |      - | -                   |         16 |                 1 |
| Exams                      |      2 | 35%                 |          - |                 - |
| Reading+Unstructured Study |      - | -                   |            |                 2 |
|----------------------------+--------+---------------------+------------+-------------------|
|                            |        |                     |            |                12 |

Each exam (midterm and final) focuses primarily, but not necessarily
exclusively, on material covered since the previous exam. In other
words, the final exam may include a few questions from first-half
material. The midterm and final are weighted equally (17.5% of your
final grade). Your lowest homework score and programming assignment
score will be dropped (separately).

### Grading

Your participation grade is based on a variety of activities. During
class I will often make use of the [Socrative](https://socrative.com)
app, so you'll need to install this on your phones. Participating in
Socrative questions and with in-class group activities is required for
a decent participation grade; an A includes asking questions either in
class or in office hours.

An additional portion of your participation grade is based on your
homework *presentations*. Every day that a homework assignment is due,
one or more students will be randomly selected to present their
solution to a portion of the assignment. You will be graded based on
*preparation* and the thoroughness of your explanations, NOT on
correctness, although you should of course strive for
correctness. Students taking late days will be required to leave the
classroom during these presentations. You must inform me *BEFORE*
class if you are taking late days to avoid being randomly selected to
present. Otherwise, if you are randomly selected to present but have
not done the assignment, you will receive a 0.

Your final grade is based on a weighted average of particular
assignment categories. You can estimate your current grade based on
your scores and these weights. You may always visit the instructor
outside of class to discuss your current standing. Assignments and
final grades use a standard grading scale shown below and will not
be curved except in rare cases when deemed necessary by the
instructor.

{{ site.data.policies.gradescale_std_v1 }}

You are always welcome to challenge a grade that you feel is unfair or
calculated incorrectly. Mistakes made in your favor will never be
corrected to lower your grade. Mistakes made not in your favor will be
corrected. *Basically, after the initial grading your score can only
go up as the result of a challenge.*

## Student Learning Outcomes

This course covers a variety of knowledge areas as categorized by the
ACM/IEEE-CS Task Force on Computing Curricula. Note that not all of
these areas are introduced in this course; some are touched upon
previously and others will be developed further in later courses. At
the end of the course, students should achieve the following learning
outcomes with the specific level of mastery:

|------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
